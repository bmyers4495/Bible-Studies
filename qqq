 III. And he says that the world was made in six days, not because the Creator stood in need of a length of time (for it is natural that God should do everything at once, not merely by uttering a command, but by even thinking of it); but because the things created required arrangement; and number is akin to arrangement; and, of all numbers, six is, by the laws of nature, the most productive: for of all the numbers, from the unit upwards, it is the first perfect one, being made equal to its parts, and being made complete by them; the number three being half of it, and the number two a third of it, and the unit a sixth of it, and, so to say, it is formed so as to be both male and female, and is made up of the power of both natures; for in existing things the odd number is the male, and the even number is the female; accordingly, of odd numbers the first is the number three, and of even numbers the first is two, and the two numbers multiplied together make six. It was fitting therefore, that the world, being the most perfect of created things, should be made according to the perfect number, namely, six: and, as it was to have in it the causes of both, which arise from combination, that it should be formed according to a mixed number, the first combination of odd and even numbers, since it was to embrace the character both of the male who sows the seed, and of the female who receives it. And he allotted each of the six days to one of the portions of the whole, taking out the first day, which he does not even call the first day, that it may not be numbered with the others, but entitling it one, he names it rightly, perceiving in it, and ascribing to it the nature and appellation of the limit. ‚Äî location: [209](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01ED4MJS4&location=209) ^ref-15873[m

[32m+[m[32mIt is remarkable that the idea of ‚ÄúSalvation‚Äù should be so closely connected with the making of the grave. Respect to the dead is a prayer for the whole family and its permanence and prosperity. The dead has gone to be a god with the gods; the tomb is his temple; and the worship of this new god is inaugurated with the grave and epitaph, which are the discharge of a vow to secure his blessing for the entire household. In the two dedications Timon the foundling is regarded as identified with Zeus the Thunderer and with Zeus of Dagoutta. ‚Äî location: [2664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2664) ^ref-29328[m

[32m+[m[32mFrom the beginning of its history Christianity was brought into the closest relations with the state and the religion of the Emperors. Paul obscurely hints at the worship of the reigning Emperor, ‚Äúhim that calls himself God,‚Äù and the dead Emperors in 2 Thessalonians 2:1‚Äì12. The Revelation of John is absorbed in the conflict against him that sits on the throne of Satan. After the time of Vespasian ‚Äúa charge of Christianity was tested by calling on the accused to perform the ceremonies of loyalty and worship of the Emperors.‚Äù[1] From the beginning to the end of the contest with the State this worship of the Emperors was the immediate enemy of the Christians in a far more pressing way than the worship of Jupiter or the other gods. A few indulgent governors of provinces were willing to accept as the test of loyalty for accused Christians their oath by the salvation of the Emperor;[2] and even Tertullian permitted this oath to be taken by Christians.[3] ‚Äî location: [2681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2681) ^ref-28248[m

[32m+[m[32mThus the vows for salvation of the Emperor illustrate the unity of the household, a feature so marked in Acts 16:15, 33, 1 Corinthians 16:15. They also show how closely the person of the Emperor was connected with the life and conduct of the people in the provinces, in the first place of the cultivators of the great estates, and in the second place of the ordinary provincials who came to imitate more and more the fashion that ruled on the estates. ‚Äî location: [2710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2710) ^ref-53046[m

An example of a similar dedication, erected by the city of Apollonia, is published on p. 44 above. Here the Emperor and his family, who are summed up as ‚Äúour Lords,‚Äù are conjoined with the body of tenants (coloni). The latter are organized as a religious association uniting in the worship of the Lords Emperors.

[32m+[m[32mA number of the German critics, followed by many outside of Germany, used until recently to say without hesitation that Augustus never issued any decree ordering a census, that there never was under the Empire any regular system of census, that where any casual census was held the presence of the wife was not required but only of the husband, and that his presence was never required at his original home. ‚Äî location: [3128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3128) ^ref-24370[m

Then, when this transference had been made in defiance of historical truth, the circumstances and manner of a Roman census (which as a matter of fact were unknown to the critics) were manipulated and misrepresented by Luke so as to make it appear that Joseph of Nazareth came to Bethlehem to be counted (which there was no need for him to do), and that Mary also came to be counted (although, even if her husband had for some reason been required to appear at Bethlehem, there was no possible cause why her presence should also be called for). ‚Äî location: [3136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3136) ^ref-26698[m

The one mentioned by Pliny occurred in 48 apparently.[1] Tacitus mentions a census held in the provinces of Gaul at the end of the events of a.d. 61. Vespasian and Titus were censors in 73‚Äì74. We now see that these correspond in a loose way to the census periods of a.d. 34, 48, 62 and 76; but the correspondence is inexact. ‚Äî location: [3341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3341) ^ref-57535[m

Not merely were written census returns handed in; but the entire population had to present themselves personally for inspection. This he infers from a passage in a London Papyrus with practical certainty, and rightly calls it a very important point.[1] ‚ÄúAccordingly,‚Äù as he says, ‚ÄúJoseph and Mary in the legend of Luke must both go to Bethlehem.‚Äù The argument which Wilcken has in mind is that Luke, who knew this regulation to hold in every census, invented this detail regarding the journey of Mary in order to be true to the custom. Luke‚Äôs narrative used to be called a legend, because it was historically false. Now it is called by Wilcken a legend because every detail has been demonstrated to be exactly correct. There is no way of satisfying those people who have made up their minds. ‚Äî location: [3780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3780) ^ref-48830[m

The only inference which he draws from this is that the legend arose out of the law and practice. ‚Äî location: [3793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3793) ^ref-19378[m
