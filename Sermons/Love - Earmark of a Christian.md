# Love - Earmark of a Christian

- What is Love?
	- When discussing biblical love, we often note that there are at least 6 types of love.
		- Agape
		- Philia
		- Storge
		- Eros
		- Philutia - self-love
		- Xenia - Hospitality
	- Even though these words are not all used in Scriptures, they are certainly discussed to
	some extent, some have both good and bad connotations!
		- Though philutia is not used in the Scriptures, the idea is discussed and normally
		seen in a negative light (ie pride)
		- Eros is generally seen in a negative light, EXCEPT in the marriage relationship (1
		Cor 7:8-9)
			- Because of the people's sexual deviancy, by the first century "eros"
			generally had bad connotations behind it
	- The focus of this morning, however, is agape!
		- It is important that we discern between the different types because we do not have
		such differentiation in our English language.
		- This is the love we are to have for all men, including our enemies (Mat 5:43-44)
			- He gave us a perfect example of love (Rom 5:7-9)
			- This is a lot more challenging than we give it credit!
		- Love is not tolerance for sin; on the contrary.
			- Love is the driving factor that brought Jesus to the cross to drive out
			sin!
			- We would do well to examine Jesus' interactions with those who were in
			sin (John 4; John 8:1-11)
				- He does not treat them as if they're disgusting and without value.
				- He does not commend to even suggest they should continue sinning,
				in fact, He is rather blunt that they should stop sinning!
		- The Bible clearly teaches we must be able to grasp the idea of agape!

- Love is the Crux of the Law
	- Jesus says there are two laws which are important over all others (Mat 22:37-40)!
		- Love the Lord your God
		- Love your neighbor
	- If you were to look at each individual law, they would individually fall into one of these
	categories
		- For example, if you love God, you are going to want to worship Him correct, and
		not put other gods before Him.
		- If you love your neighbor you will not want to steal from Him
			- Paul defines this love as one that "does not seek self" (1 Cor 13:4-7)
			- In fact, it seems that this was the main thing missing at the church in
			Corinth - chapter thirteen is Paul's answer to all of the issues the church
			was having.
	- At another point in time a lawyer asked Jesus "who is my neighbor"(Luke 10:29-37)
		- Notice Luke said why the lawyer asked this "trying to justify himself"
		- He wanted to exclude people from that bubble of neighbors!
			- He was probably a Jewish lawyer attempting to justify his disdain for
			non-Jews!
			- Maybe specifically the Samaritans!
		- We need to understand when God said "love your neighbor," it is all-inclusive -
		not just our brethren.
			- To reiterate, this does not mean accept their sin!
			- This does mean to be willing to help those in need!
- Love is Better Than Any Gift (1 Cor 13)
	- The thirteenth verse always fascinated me!
		- According to Paul love is above hope and faith, but why?
		- One fact I can of which I can think is that faith and hope bring us to heaven, but
		love persists through heaven!
		- Also, perhaps there's the fact that our love is a manifestation of love; faith and
		hopes mean nothing if not for love!
	- No matter, consider the context of this chapter in the entirety of this book
		- division was rampant in Corinth, evidently
			- Chapter 1-4 - Division based on their teacher
			- Chapter 5 - They are unwilling to divide on Scriptural matters - adultery
				- The purpose was so that his soul might be saved (5:5)
			- Chapter 6 - They used the law of the Gentiles to deal with their civil
			issues
			- Chapter 7 - Given the current distress, it is better to remain unmarried,
			do not separate from your spouse
			- Chapter 8-10 - Division over Christian liberties
			- Chapter 11 - Divisions of rich and poor
			- Chapter 12-14 - Division over spiritual gifts
			- Chapter 15 - unity in the resurrection
			- Chapter 16 - Concluding farewells.
		- It seems like they did not understand in what we are to have unity
		- Love seems to be the remedy!
			- In each issue Paul presents, the lack of love they had for one another was
			apparent!
			- A lack of knowledge and wisdom was part of their issue, but love was the
			main issue!
