Text: 1 Cor 15:3-19

## Introduction

## Discussion

- The Resurrection and the Christian
	- Notice Paul's words in the texts
		- If the resurrection did not happen, we should not be here this morning
		- All of our faith hinges on the fact of this one point in history
		- If Jesus did not rise, we will not be raised, period.
	- The context of this passage is that there were some who evidently wanted to discredit
	the resurrection
		- Historically speaking, gnosticism was a big issue in the first century
			- There were several splits of gnosticism, but one major one taught that
			Jesus was not born divine, His divinity came upon him at the point of His
			baptism.
			- They further explained that His divinity left Him at the point of His
			crucifixion
			- They taught that Jesus really was not resurrected, it was more akin to
			an illusion or something along these lines
		- Which brings us to what we were just considering; if Jesus were not truly raised
		from the dead, we would not have any hope in Him.
		- It is His resurrection that gives us a reason to hope!
	- What this means is that we cannot "offer the right hand of fellowship" to anyone who
	teaches that the resurrection did not actually happen.
		- There are issues that we can have varying opinions on, and we'll talk about this
		in another sermon at another time.
		- However, this is not one of those topics; we must have unity on the fact that
		Jesus did indeed resurrect!
	- This is not to say that you have to be a history buff or anything along those lines to
	be a Christian, but we would expect the resurrection to be evident whilst looking at
	history.
		- This will be a slightly different sermon than normal.
		- I want to spend some time considering history to show that we can see His
		resurrection through a secular lens.
- The Historicity of the Resurrection
	- It is my opinion that the fact of Jesus' resurrection is the most compelling evidence
	for Christianity.
		- Of course there are many reasons to be a Christian.
		- Not to mention the uncanny unity of the Scriptures with writers from such vastly
		different times and cultures.
		- Nevertheless, the resurrection can be seen very clearly in history.
	- Determining historicity  
		- Alexander the Great conquered the whole known world, but we only have a handful of
		documents that explain what he did from much later.
			- Plutarch recorded Alexander's actions some 400 years AFTER Alexander died.
			- I am not saying this to doubt Alexander the Great, on the contrary.
			- Alexander the Great left a huge mark on history and it is obvious that he
			did exist and most of what is written about him is obviously true
			- We know this in part because it corroborates with what we understand of
			Greek history
		- The question is: Does Jesus' resurrection (specifically have such support)?
	- Those who deny the resurrection have to contend with a few historical events.
		- There is pretty much a consensus amongst historians that Jesus existed, was
		crucified under Pontius Pilate, and his disciples at least **thought** they saw Him
		- There are at least 5-6 non biblical, historical documents which attest to this
		understanding
	- Skeptics of the resurrection have to explain how the disciples saw Jesus, and they have a
	few theories.
		- Some believe that Jesus was never dead on the cross.
			- In fact, Josephus - a Jewish historian that worked for the Romans - said
			that he had an acquaintance that survived crucifixion
				- In this case Josephus saw 3 of his acquaintances nailed to
				crosses.
				- He requested that they be taken down; and were.
				- Even with the best medical expertise only one survived.
			- One problem with this theory is that John unknowingly gave evidence
			against this by explaining that water and blood came pouring out when He was
			stabbed by the spear.
				- It is telling because he had no way of understanding why water and
				blood would have come out
				- Yet we know today that this points toward a pierced heart -
				something He could not have survived.
				- Plus, the Romans would have only done this if they thought He was
				already dead; unlike the thieves whose legs were broken
		- There's the theory that Jesus never rose, it was just a myth perpetrated by Jesus'
		disciples
			- The glaring issue with this theory is that all these "myth making"
			disciples were tortured and died in extraordinary ways.
			- It seems extremely unlikely that someone might go through the things the
			disciples went through if it was all made up.
				- In recent years, this is somewhat similar to the watergate scandal
				- 12 of the most powerful men could not keep a secret; instead caved
				under the watergate scandal
				- Whereas again, 12 followers of Christ did the exact opposite.
		- The final idea - and the one championed by a lot of historians today is the
		"hallucination" hypothesis.
			- They believe that several of the disciples shared in a hallucination of
			the resurrected Christ
			- It is almost humorous to see the extremes that these people are willing to
			go, because the people that say this are otherwise intelligent people
			- Hallucinations are not shared; they're personal experiences.
			- Also, people who are hallucinating probably are not going to be stable or
			organized enough to start a movement of the magnitude of Christianity.
	- In the end, the Bible seems to give the best explanation to explain the events of the
	first century.
