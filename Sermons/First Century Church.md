# First Century Church

# Introduction

- According to a [Gallup
poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx) "US Church Membership has fallen below half for the first time" 
	- The first time this poll was conducted was in 1937 where 73% of Americans claimed to be "a
	part of a church"
	- For the next six decades that percentage stayed around 70%
	- By 2020, that number had dropped to 47%
- So what how do we prevent this from being the case?
	- I am not here to suggest any new idea or profound method of evangelism.
	- I would suggest that a good start is to look at the first century church and how they
	grew.
- I want to especially what I believe to be the key attributes of the first century church. 

#Body

- Fellowship of the First Century
	- Greek word - Koinoia
		- Used to mean fellowship, association, community, communion, joint participation 
		- a gift jointly contributed, a collection, a contribution, as exhibiting an
		embodiment and proof of fellowship 
		- The word is defined for us and exemplified in verses 44 and 45
		- Those who have been in the military might consider the fellowship you have with
		your fellow soldiers - something in common
	- Notice, they were together **daily**!
		- Paul taught to bear one another's burdens (Gal 6:2)
			- They were together all the time, so that they could bear each other's
			burdens; they knew what their brothers needed.
			- It was much deeper than a group of friends, it was family!
		- This formula of being together all the time, allowed them to grow closer as they
		grew closer to God.
	- Not only did they spend time with one another, they also gave to each other as was needed
	[^1] 
	- It seems that some churches were very quickly moved from the "traditions" of this first
	body (e.g Corinth)
	- If we are honest, are we like the earliest example of the church in this sense?
		- We talk about how we are the first century church; but to my shame, we might have
		failed in this regard.
		- Sometimes I wonder if we; like the people of Israel did at times (Hos 6:6), do the
		right things with the wrong attitude
		- No doubt, there love for one another was an integral part of their growth
		(spiritual and numerical).
- The Doctrine of the First Century
	- Paul summed the first century in Eph 4:1.
		- Notice the connection Paul makes between unity with the doctrine they were
		teaching
		- Briefly notice the doctrine he was teaching we must have in common!
			- One body - defined church earlier (Eph 1:22-23).
			- One Spirit - There is no other word from the Spirit than that which we
			have in the Bible
			- One hope - the resurrection is our hope (1 Cor 15)
			- One baptism - not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of
			a good conscience toward God (1 Pet 3:21)
		- There might be implications in each of these categories, but this is the bedrock
		of Christian faith
	- We need to be on the same page in regards to doctrine - perhaps especially the doctrine
	which Paul lay out here.
		- It is why Paul told Timothy to continue in diligence or study in order to be a
		good workman (2 Tim 2:15)
		- This is why the Bereans were noble (Acts 17:11).
		- Finally, in order to be certain that we are not being carried away by "another"
		gospel, we must know what the true gospel is (Gal 1:6).
- The History of Christendom
	- When we look back at Christendom and its evolution throughout the centuries, we can find
	clear departures from God's word
	- For example - perhaps the first departure was in organization
		- Instead of having overseers in each autonomous church as prescribed by Paul (Titus
		1:5, 1 Tim 5), the church began to appoint parish overseers - an elder over several
		churches
		- Then from there we reach the papacy
	- Point is somewhere along the way, we especially lost the brotherly love which Luke
	expressed in the first century church.
		- The idea that laity were not able to understand the Scriptures is a killer to
		Christianity; as people were not allowed to study.
		- The church also adopted the mass system which taught "church" was only necessary
		on special occasion.
