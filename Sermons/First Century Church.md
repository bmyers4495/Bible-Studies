# First Century Church

- Fellowship of the First Century
	- Greek word - Koinoia
		- Used to mean fellowship, association, community, communion, joint participation 
		- a gift jointly contributed, a collection, a contribution, as exhibiting an
		embodiment and proof of fellowship 
		- The word is defined for us and exemplified in verses 44 and 45
		- Those who have been in the military might consider the fellowship you have with
		your fellow soldiers - something in common
	- Notice, they were together **daily**!
		- Paul taught to bear one another's burdens (Gal 6:2)
			- They were together all the time, so that they could bear each other's
			burdens; they knew what their brothers needed.
			- It was much deeper than a group of friends, it was family!
		- This formula of being together all the time, allowed them to grow closer as they
		grew closer to God.
	- Not only did they spend time with one another, they also gave to each other as was needed
