Passage: [[Isa 43:7]]
# Purpose of God's Creation

# Introduction

- What is the meaning of life?
	- Throughout the ages there have been many philosopher who vainly attempted to answer this question from a secular viewpoint.
	- Solomon said the whole duty of man was to "fear God and keep His commandments." (Ecc 12:13)
- Our journey in the pursuit of determining the "why", first, brings us to Isa 43
	- Even if we strictly consider the contextual position of the verse, there is no denying a principal that is taught in this passage.
	- When God created the World, He created it for His glory!
- I think we will find clear evidence of His purpose as we study together, so that we can answer that age old philosophical question to the meaning of life!

# The Biblical Answer

- God Created man in His image (Gen 1:27), but why?
	- Why do we have statues of men such as Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, etc?
	- The purpose of all of these memorials, is to honor the person being imaged by them!
		- We are lifting them up as heroes who made a difference in American history.
		 - For example, Lincoln will always be remembered as the president that freed the slaves.
	- Imagine the image of a seraphim - a six winged creature flying high in the air.
		- It's interesting to note what these great creatures which often capture our interest always are found in the Scriptures singing.
		- "Holy Holy Holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory" (Isa 6:3).
	- Further David was very clear in his hymns that the "heavens declare the glory of God" (Psa 19:1)
	- We can stand, look at the universe (piece of) the glory of God (Rom 1:20-21)
	-  The Bible is crystal clear on the purpose of Creation - to bring God glory.

> [!QUOTE] Timatheaus Creation
> When the father creator saw the creature which he had made moving and living, the created image of the eternal gods, he rejoiced, and in his joy determined to make the copy still more like the original; and as this was eternal, he sought to make the universe eternal, so far as might be.

#  Biblical Definition

- What does it mean to glorify?
	- Are we to take from this that God needs us to "make Him glorious"?
	- As if we are the ones who beautify Him?
- In practical terms, when we built the statues mentioned earlier (Lincoln, Washington), did we make those men great?
	- No, they were made great by the things they did.
	- All we did was recognize their contributions to this country.
- We can even change the word to "magnify" as in Phi 1:20
	- Man has been in awe for centuries when they look through telescopes
		- Think about the vastness of space and its wonders.
		- Not only the vastness of space, but it's funny that we need a telescope to see things that are so vastly larger than us.
	- In the same way we use telescopes to see the greatness of space, God made the world to magnify, or show Him!

# Idolaters Miss the Point

- Another phenomenon we find throughout history (and certainly the Scriptures) is the practice of idolatry
- These are the folks who worship the created rather than the creator (Rom 1:25).
	- It does say something about the greatness of His creation.
	- Nonetheless, idolatry is the complete opposite of God's purpose in creation.
	- He doesn't want you to look at the sun and moon, stars, etc and think "wow, those are so great, they must be gods."
	- Or perhaps even worse - worshipping a statue created by His own creation
		- It always amazed me how man could build something, then bow down to it as God (Gen 31:19-35)
		- What about money?
- We are in awe of God's creation, scientist are still learning more and more about it every single day!
	- What does that tell you about the creator?
	- The fact that His creation is too vast for us to understand should tell us a lot about Him!

# Conclusion

- Next week we will discuss why God chose to create the particular world in which we live.
- However, can you say that  you are living up to this purpose and like Paul, you are magnifying God with this body He gave you?
