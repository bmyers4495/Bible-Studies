Passage:
# You Have a Great Inheritance!

# Promise to Abraham

- God's promise to Abraham (Gen 12:1-3).
- Abraham's seed will receive the land (Gen 12:6,7).
	- Inheritance was an important theme throughout Jewish history.
	- Through Abraham, they were to have a great inheritance of land.
- The Jews were constantly being reminded of the promise throughout their travels in the wilderness (Lev 20:24; Deut 6:3, 11:9, 26:9, 26:15).
- Finally, the land is given to Joshua and the Israelites as was promised to their father, Abraham (Josh 1-24)

# Promise Continued

- Having been in Cana for some 400 years or so, David continues writing about a land inheritance (Ps 37:9, 11, 22, 29, 34).
	- He is contrasting the righteous and the wicked; the wicked will be cut off, the righteous will inherit the land.
	- Why would David use language like "inherit the land" if Israel had already done so?
- Another 300 years pass and Isaiah further explains the inheritance of land (Isa 60:21; 65:9).
	- The Gentiles were going to be a part of this land as well (Isa 60:3; 65:1).
	- We will have peace in this land!
- Finally, 600 years later Jesus quotes from Psa 37:11 (Mat 5:5).
	- It is interesting to note that this is the last time the language is used.
	- Matthew is writing to a Jewish audience.
- Each of these references would have brought the Jewish mind back to Abraham.

#  Promise Realized

- Though "inherit the land" is not discussed any further in Bible, the apostles did refer to an inheritance (Gal 3; Eph 1:14-18, 5:5; Heb 9:15; 1 Pet 1:4)
- The inheritance of Abraham is for all, as Isaiah prophesied.
	- Paul connected the promise to Abraham (Gal 3:8) to the Salvation of the Gentiles (Gal 3:14).
	- Further, Paul explains the seed mentioned is Christ (Gal 3:16).
	- Just as Isaiah prophesied, the Gentiles will be God's people!
- Our inheritance is eternal (1 Pet 1:4).
- The inheritance we have through the seed of Abraham is the Kingdom of God (Eph 5:5).
- Because of this inheritance, we can have peace (Rom 5:1).
