- Weak Foundation of the World
	- It is important we notice this text in its entire context.
		- This is the conclusion of the sermon on the mount!
		- By way of introduction, Jesus had already told the people that their righteousness
		must exceed that of the Pharisees (Mat 5:20)
		- He continues in this sermon poking holes in some of the traditions of the
		Pharisees by comparing them to God's whole intention for mankind. 
			- He is not saying the law is incorrect, He is saying that the Jews were
			misusing the law!
			- As He is going through this list, He talks about the reward of the
			Pharisees, and that it is from man (Mat 6:2).
		- Jesus has been speaking about the fragile nature of everything this world has to
		offer (Mat 6:19-21) 
		- In other words, do not build your faith on the weak foundation that the world
		offers.
	- Pascal described a "God shaped hole" in each person's heart!
		- In my estimation, this is consistent with biblical teaching (ie Eccl)
			- Solomon tried every which way to fill this "God shaped hole"
			- In the same way, mankind has always tried to find contentment where there
			is none!
				- We try everything from work, to cars, etc
				- The fact is that anything we attempt to build our trust will fail!
	- It is interesting to note that the people who Jesus seems to be primarily discussing are
	supposed to be very religious!
		- Religious people; even Christians can build their house on the sand!
		- This, of course, gets into what are our motivations for serving God?
		- Do we want to (like the Pharisees) be seen of man?
- Strong Foundation of Christ
	- On the other hand, notice what happens when we apply the principles taught in the sermon
	on the mount!
		- Notice the logical progression of this sermon that Jesus is preaching:
			- You have heard, but I say (Mat 5:21-48)
			- The reward of those who put world first; specifically the religious leaders (Mat
			6)
			- He deals with hypocritical judgement (Mat 7:1-6)
			- Then in a kind of conclusion he talks about seeking, finding, and entering the
			narrow gate.
		- It seems that the sermon's main focus was to look wholly toward God
		- When we are focused on God, the rest of the sermon comes easy!
	- In contrast to the Pharisees, the people that Jesus describes are humble and peaceful!
		- When we apply this sermon to our lives, we become walking examples of the
		beatitudes (Mat 5:3-12) 
		- This is how we let our lights shine!
		- In a world of self-centered pride, we ought to be God-focused and humble!
	- And when we apply what Jesus taught on this sermon, our faith will be built of the rock
	that will not be moved! 
- Results of Our Foundations
	- Since we have established what the different grounds on which we can establish our house,
	what are the consequences of decisions?
	- It is first important to note that our decision does not necessarily affect whether or not
	good things will happen to us!
		- Job was said to be a righteous man, yet all sorts of horrible things happened to
		him BECAUSE of his faithful foundation
		- On the other hand, we find the lamenting prophets looking around him and finding
		the wicked to prosper (Jer 12:1).
		- In fact, in this very sermon, Jesus says that the rain falls on the just and the
		unjust (Mat 5:45)
	- Our decision on where we build our faith should affect how we respond to the rain!
		- One thing with which everyone agrees is that life is tough!
		- This is precisely the reason that Jesus came and died!
			- The Hebrew writer explains that we have a high priest that understands our
			sorrows!
			- The puts the biblical worldview in stark contrast with the other
			worldviews we could have!
			- We not only have hope, but our the Jesus - the basis of our hope can truly
			say that He understands us!
			- I am always impressed by the solid foundation on which Paul established his faith
			(Phil 1:21).
	- One of the beautiful facts of God's word, is that He gives us the opportunity to choice
	where we build our house!
		- Joshua put it this way: as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord (Josh
		24:15).
		- What about you; where do you build your faith?
