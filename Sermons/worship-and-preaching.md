## Introduction:

- The Lord's church is built on teaching; it is the bedrock on which Christ built His church!
- By scriptural teaching, the church maintains its ID as described in the NT (Mat 16:6, 12; Gal 5:9)
- Worship is mentioned in some form 190 times in the NT (Mat 4:10)
- We should teach the word of the Lord with reverence, meaning we give the heart's feelings expressed in outward acts (Heb 12:28-29)
- Proper attitude is a necessity for acceptable worship (John 4:24)
- Reverence means profound respect mingled with fear and affection
- It is important that we perform our duty to the world, which includes all creation (Mat 28:9-20)
- The early church continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and teaching, meaning continually and regularly (Acts 2:42; Acts 20:7)
- We can save those who hear us by taking heed to ourselves and to our teaching (1 Tim 4:16; Jam 1:21)
- The church is responsible for training one to teach or preach (2 Tim 2:2; Gal 1:6-9) "And the things that you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also." (2 Tim 2:2)
- Feelings and truth are not equal (1 Cor 2:9-11)


## Discussion:

- **I. Christian Education:**
  - The Law of Moses mandated the teaching, observation, and obedience of God's law.
  - Israel's downfall occurred when they neglected God's law, leading to the dark ages for the church.
    - The temple was defiled with idols.
    - The Ark of the covenant was removed from its place.
  - Restoration to God's favor required a reinstatement of God's word (2 Kin 22:8-22; Neh 8; Mal
  3:7-18).
    - Destruction resulted from a lack of knowledge (Hos 4:6)
    - The lack of knowledge stemmed from:
       - Unwillingness to study.
       - Leaders giving in to idolatry instead of teaching truth.
    - Proper teaching of God’s word was essential for maintenance.
  - The growth and maintenance of the church rely on teaching the word of the Lord.
  - Paul's directive to Timothy was to preach the word (2 Tim 4:1-4).

- **II. The Noble:**
  - Participation in spirit and truth is crucial, regardless of one's position in worship(John 4:24).
    - Error should not be permitted, especially during worship.
    - Ensuring this involves:
       - Paying attention.
       - Comparing teachings with scriptures, as the Bereans did.
       - All aspects of worship, including the sermon, aim to impact lives.
  - The Bereans were noble for receiving the word eagerly and verifying it daily with scripture(Acts
  17:11).
    - They didn't idolize Paul but prioritized alignment with scripture.
    - Their diligence in verifying teachings prevented potential errors.
  - Engagement in worship can be challenging at times due to fatigue or hunger.
    - Despite teachings emphasizing spiritual over physical needs, it's challenging to prioritize.
    - Persistence is necessary for growth and habit-breaking.
  - Humility is essential, as some may disregard teachings based on the teacher's age or stature.

CONCLUSION:

- I am not trying to say that the sermon is the “most” important “act of worship” – as if we should be ranking their importance.
  - In fact, if I had to say one is the “most important,” I’d have to go with the Lord’s supper.
- Though it is interesting that one of the first things the church did was “continuing steadfastly in the apostle’s doctrine” (Acts 2:42).
- When we come together in one place and listen to a piece of God’s word being presented, we ought to listen and learn.
- The end goal of God’s word is the salvation of man!
