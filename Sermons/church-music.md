#### Title: Church Music
#### Thesis: To compare our singing to the singing of the first century church
#### Text: Eph 5:19, Col 3:16



# Intro

- When we come together on the Lord's Day, one of the things we do is sing! 
- Singing has always been extremely important!
	- The first thing that the children of Israel did after God brought them out of Egypt, was
	sing a hymn (Exo 15:18-20)
	- The book of Psalms was basically a Jewish song book! 
	- The Christian church sang and even while being persecuted (Acts 16:25)
	- The redeemed were seen by John singing a new song (Rev 14:3)
- Singing is not only something we often find in the Scriptures, it is something which we are
commanded to do!


# Body

- Ephesians 5:19 vs Paganism
	- Verses 3-7 set the contexts; Paul is mainly talking to former idol worshippers
		- Often when talking to former pagans; these issues are what seem to be discussed!
		- It's also interesting that it is the same context set for us in our Colossians
		passage (Col 3:5-7)
		- Ephesus in particular was well known for their worship of a god named Artemis
		(Diana).
		- Paul contrasted Pagan feasts and the Lord's Supper (1 Cor 10:18-21)
			- Pagan worship varied depending on the god they were worshipping
			- Generally, their "worship" comparable to a drunken party (ie banquet).
			- They would have feasts, be drunk, and sing hymns often accompanied with
			the lute and/or harp.
	-  The next couple verses discuss walking in the light, walking wisely, understanding the
	will of the Lord.
		- Notice Paul says they were ONCE in darkness (v8)
		- The way we change is through finding what the way of the Lord is (v10).
	- This leads us to the discussion at hand; Ephesians 5:19
		- I did not notice until recently that verses 18 and 19 are not two different
		thoughts on two different issues.
		- Paul's putting these two things together makes it seem that he is discussing
		specifically what they Pagans did in worship.
		- So, it is as if Paul is saying: unlike the pagan's, you worship this way
- Singing in Truth
	- Last week we discussed worshipping in spirit and truth, and we did so, by looking at a
	couple examples in the Old Testament.
	- Simply put, this simply means that we have to worship according to God's word, not to add
	to or take away
		- We talked about Nadab in Abihu (Lev 10) who added to God's word
		- Another example we could discuss would be Cain's sacrifice.
	- When we think about our singing; we must decide whether we are singing in truth (according
	to God's Word).
		- Remember, this is something we are specifically told to do (Eph 5:19; Col 3:16)
		- When we are looking at direct commands, God desires us to worship him in the way
		that pleases Him!
	- Which brings us to clapping/use of instrumental music or any other addition to the
	formula.
		- The interesting part is that these things were not foreign to the people in the
		first century.
			- Those who came out of Judaism would have been used to instruments in the
			synagogues.
			- The former Pagans, would have used them as well.
			- So why did the Christians in the first century not use them?
		- Until the end of the 7th century use of the instrument in worship was
		unacceptable.
		- So let's take a minute to appreciate the significance of the context around this
		issue.
			- Paul is discussing these Pagan banquets which were basically just drunken
			parties
			- The phrase "making melody in your hearts" is word play and means "plucking
			your heart strings"
			- So, instead of plucking the strings of a harp or lute; pluck your heart
			strings!
			- The Christian's heart ought to be his instrument!
- Singing in Spirit
	- When we discussed worship, we considered that God desires pure worship from the heart
	(Mic 6:6-8).
		- God was unpleased because their worship had not affect on how they lived
		- They, for example celebrate the passover and not recognize that God saved them
		from captivity
	- One more thing about instruments and I'll be done, but what purpose do they serve?
		- If the answer is anything to do with how I feel or my preferences; it is the wrong
		answer - worship is not about me
		- Worship is about glorifying God and recognizing what HE did for us!
		-  Repayment illus
	- Perhaps the more pressing matter is where is my mind when I am singing?
		- Are we considering the lyrics of the music?
		- Do we sing about "the old rugged cross" and not even consider the pain and anguish
		that Jesus withstood on it?
	- Back to Colossians 3:16 and Ephesians 5:19; we are supposed to be learning from the music
	we sing.
		- How are we learning if anything is taking our focus away from what we are singing?
		- The point I made last week was that our worship in designed to affect our lives!
		- If there was one point that I think Christians need reminded of most; it is that
		Christianity is a 24/7 job and our worship services are supposed to facilitate our
		meditations!
