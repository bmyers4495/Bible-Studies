# Meaning of the Resurrection for the Christian

## The Certainty of the Resurrection

- There were some "Christians" in the first century who evidently did not believe in the resurrection of the believers.
	- There who didn't believe in Resurrection ([Acts 17:32](#References)). 
	- If this were the case, Paul argues we should "Eat Drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die!" (1 Cor 15:32).
- Nevertheless, Paul makes a very clear argument that we will be resurrected!
	- He begins by stating the fact of Jesus' resurrection (1 Cor 15:3-8)
	- With Jesus' resurrection established, since he raised, so will we (1 Cor 15:13)!
- Even Jesus mentions the resurrection ([Mat 22:30-31](#References)).

## The Nature of the Resurrection


- Paul is very clear that it will be a spiritual resurrection (1 Cor 15:44)
	- He is responding to the question "How are the dead raised up? And with what body do they come?" (1 Cor 15:35)
	- Paul continues down this train of though discussing different type of bodies, as an analogy to explain that we will be raised in a spiritual body.
	- Based on Paul's immediate response, it would seem that he did not find this to be a particularly wise question (1 Cor 15:36)
- The much more pertinent question was the implication of our resurrection (1 Cor 15:54-56) - death has been defeated; all thanks to Christ.
- 
## Implications of the Resurrection 


- Why does the teaching of the resurrection matter to me?
	- First, as was mentioned earlier, Paul states that if there is on resurrection, we ought to eat drink, and be merry.
	- Furthermore, the fact of the resurrection should bring us to action!
- Notice Paul's conclusion (1 Cor 15:18)
	- Because there will be a resurrection, we ought to continue strong in the Lord.
	- In other words, our faith should be invigorated when considering our promise if resurrection!
