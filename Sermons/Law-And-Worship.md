    - Text: John 4:23-24

# Introduction

- One of the most important questions for the Christian should be: is my worship pleasing?
	- This will be the question if we have the attitude set out by John (1 John 4:19)
	- If we love Him, we should desire to be pleasing to Him in all aspects of life!
- It seems clear that one of the things which we learn from the OT is God's attitude towards
worship (Rom 15:4)
- That said, I want to suggest that the OT teaches the same thing as the NT concerning God's
**Attittude** towards worship (John 4:23-24).
	 

# Body

- God Desired Worship in Truth
	- To study the law and worship, fist important to note the nature of Leviticus!
		- This whole book was written to give detailed instructions to the Levites in worship
			- The Levites were the priestly tribe (Deut 21:5)
			- Each chapter lays out practices to which they must adhere in specific
			detail
		- Notice for example the peace offering of Lev 3
            - Notice the specifics!
                - The type - without blemish (v1)
                - Where to slaughter - at the door of the tabernacle (v2)
                - Even how it is to be gutted (v4)
            - When God gave them specifics, it was important that they followed exactly what He
            said.
    - Nadab and Abihu give us a great example of what God expects (Lev 10)
        - There's a interesting word study here!
            - Interestingly, the original word translated "strange" or "profane" means
            something like "border" - they offered something that was outside of God's word!
            - The Septuagint makes it even clearer by using the word translated another in a
            quantitative sense
            - As interesting as it might be; Moses clearly defines this word at the end of the
            verse when he writes "which He had not commanded them."
        - The main point of the story of Nadab and Abihu seems to be rather simple - do not go
        outside of God's Word (especially in worship)
        - Also, this is a story which God wanted the children of Israel to remember (Num 3:4) 
        - Moses expresses this in rather simple terms (Deut 4:2).
    - God clearly desired them to worship Him truthfully - according to His Word
        - The reason Abel's offering was pleasing was because it was what expected of him
        (Gen 4:3-10)
           - When we start looking at what we want in worship to God; we might want to think
           about Cain and Abel.
           - Cain's offering was what he wanted to offer, not what God had commanded from him.
        - Noah had to use Gopher wood as God commanded (Gen 6:22)
        - Abraham needed to travel exactly where God directed Him (Heb 11:8)

- God Desired Worship in Spirit
    - No doubt there were times throughout Israel's history in which they worshipped Him without
    "truth," arguably God saw spiritual engagement perhaps more important than the letter of the
    law!
        - If we were to do a survey of Old Law and the history of Israel, we'd find that Israel
        had faltered in one or both of these areas at most point throughout their history - either
        they worshipped with heart, but not truth; with truth, but not heart; or neither heart nor
        truth.
        - It does seem that when one of these (truth or spirit) is taken from the equation; the
        other is soon to go with it.
    - Isaiah, speaking as a mouth piece for God, said that Israel did not know Him (Isa 1:3).
        - During the time of Isaiah, Israel had many issues; and Isaiah's job was to basically
        present them with the fact that they were about to be taken captive.
        - Notice though in this same context Isa 1:11-13
            - The sacrifices **WHICH GOD COMMANDED** were no longer pleasing to Him, why?
            - Their hearts were not in it; they would perhaps say and do the correct things; but
            their hearts were not changed.
                - It is as if they checked it off of their "to be a good Jew" checklist
                - Do we not do the same thing today?
            - Isaiah clearly states their issue (Isa 29:13).
    - Isaiah was not the only one prophet to highlight Israel's heart issue
        - God wrote through Hosea that He wanted mercy rather than sacrifice (Hos 6:6).
        - Similarly Amos expresses that God was not pleased with their festivals, and was not
        willing to accept them (Amos 5:21-24)
        - Micah shares the same exact message (Mic 6:6-8)

# Conclusion

- If there were any topic on which we needed to be sure; it is that of our worship to God!
- Can we (at the Florence church of Christ) say that we worship according to the truth?
- Further can each of us individually say "I am spiritually engaged when I worship"
- These questions are amongst some of the most important questions we can ask as worshippers of God
    - We saw plainly what God desires and requires of His worshippers
    - What about each of us?
