# Giving

## Introduction

- To find the context here, let's look at 1 Cor 16 for a minute.
	- Paul commanding the church regarding the "collection of the saints".
	- The purpose of this collection was, at least in part, to bring to the church in
	Jerusalem who were in need (v 3). 
	- Notice, starting in verse 5, Paul is planning his trip, namely that he will go through
	Macedonia, than to them in Corinth (v 5).
	- It seems like at the point of writing, Paul has made it to Macedonia (v 2).
	- So, the context of 2 Corinthians 9 is still the same "collection" or contribution we
	find in 1 Cor 16 - a contribution on the first day of the week.
- My of pointing that out is simply to say that 1 Cor 16 issues the command and 2 Cor 9 speaks
more to the how and what (attitude and how much)
- With that in mind, my main focus will be each of us individually giving during what we call the
"contribution".
- I think Paul's main points here are that we must be ready to give and we give according to our
abilities!

## Discussion

- Readiness (9:1-5)
	- Paul is telling them they better prepare for his coming; same message in 1 Cor 16.
		- It is almost humorous how he is trying to motivate them to prepare
		- In essence, he is saying: "it sure would be a shame if the Macedonians come and
		you are not ready like I told them you would be"
	- Even more than readiness, it seems like Paul is speaking to their willingness!
		- This is discussed in a little more depth as we continue in this chapter.
		- It is however, clear that he is trying to motivate them to ensure that they are
		doing what they said they were going to do.
	- This section goes back to what they should have been doing for what has been estimated
	as a year or so: "laying aside as he prospered" (1 Cor 16:1).
		- I am not saying that this is a specific command that doesn't apply to us.
		- Money is required for operation, benevolence, and spreading the gospel.
	- Perhaps the most important part of this whole section is the end of verse 5 - this was
	to be given through generosity; not obligation.
		- I would make a distinction between the church's (as a whole) attitude toward
		giving and the individual
		- Most of what we have seen so far seems mainly to be speaking to the church's
		willingness to be a beacon of light, but later he will speak to the individual's
		attitude when giving. 
- Ability (9:6-7)
	- Each of us needs to ask "how much should I give?" 
		- This is one of the difference between giving in the old law versus giving under
		the law of Christ.
			- Under the old law they would give a tenth (Lev 27:30-34)
		- Under this law we give as we prosper - each of us must decide based on what we
		have/get.
		- It is completely my opinion that I would never push on anyone that 10% would be a
		good start!	
	- I have a problem seeing this as a statement to say "if I give more I will receive more
	financially" like what the prosperity preachers might preach
		- Along these lines, I think it is absolutely true that God provides and our giving
		should reflect our belief in God's provisions!
		- Truth be told, verse 6 can be applied in many ways; basically we cannot expect
		anything to happen if we are not liberal in our giving!
	- Verse seven re-emphasizes several points he has already made.
		- We give according to what we can purpose in our hearts
			- Practically speaking, when we sit down to do our budgets, this should be a
			prayerful consideration!
			- On a somewhat separate topic, when you look at your budget; is it
			indicative of a person/family who wants to be pleasing to God?
		- I mentioned earlier that it is important that we do not give out of obligation,
		noticed how Paul sums it up here (v 7).
			- Like any aspect of worship, it cannot be done of obligation; to check it
			off a checklist.
			- This is something to be done willingly!
			- The Greek word translated "cheerful" is "hilaros".
				- It is obvious to see which word we get from this!
				- It paints a picture that this should be a joyful occasion for us! 
## Conclusion

- This topic is often one which we do not want to discuss.
- It is a challenge to discuss something as integral into each of our lives as the pocket book!
- This is however a fairly clear cut command from the apostle Paul!
- So when we come together on the first day of the week, it is important that we understand how we
give!
	- We must give with readiness
	- We must give according to our ability!
