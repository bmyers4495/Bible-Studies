# INTRODUCTION:

-	Esther has given a wonderful example of how God's followers should be brave!
	-	Although she faced many dangers, she did what was best for God's people!
	-	Not only did Esther face things that would make people fearful, she faced DEATH!
-	Christians can learn a lot from reading this great book and there are three main points that I will focus upon!
-	The context of Esther.
-	The call and conclusion of Esther.
-	The call of God's followers today!

# DISCUSSION:

-	The Context of Esther.
	-	There are several people mentioned throughout Esther of whom it is important to know!
		-	King Ahasuerus was the king of a kingdom that was from India to Ethiopia (Est 1:1).
			-	This is OVER 127 provinces!
			-	He reigned from the Shushan Palace.
		-	Esther was the new queen introduced to us in Esther 2!
			-	The previous queen was queen Vashti who refused to come to the feast to show herself off to the people (Est. 1:9-12).
				-	This was considered very disrespectful to the king (Est 1:16-17).
				-	The king signed a decree that Vashti can never come before the king again (Est. 1:19-20).
				-	Then the king began to search for another queen and found a beautiful maiden named Esther and made her queen(Est. 2)!
				-	The previous queen was in the right
			-	Esther was a Jew (Est. 2:5-8).
		-	Mordecai was the father-figure of Esther.
			-	Esther's father and mother had died (Est. 1:7).
			-	Mordecai was the man who reared Esther even through many captivities (Est. 2:6).
		-	Haman over all the princes (Est. 3:1).
	-	The events that lead to the Esther four extremely important to understand Esther's great courage!
		-	Esther did not tell the king of her kindred (the Jews) at the beginning as Mordecai had charged her (Est 2:20).
		-	Mordecai didn't want to bow down before the king as was the law before of the land.

		-	Haman advised the king of the thing which Mordecai didn't do and asked the king to sign a law that would “destroy” the Jews (Est. 3:7-9).
	-	 The king signed and told Haman to do what he willed to do these people.
		-	It is important to note that Esther still has not told of her kindred, so the king made this law blindly because he had know knowledge that Esther, his queen was a Jew!
-	The Call and Conclusion of Esther.
	-	Esther's courage is shown for the first time and continues through the book!
		-	Esther didn't know about this new law which the king signed until Mordecai told her (Est. 4:7).
		-	When she finally came to knowledge of what was happening, she was CONVICTED that something must be done about this situation.
			-	It was such a serious thing because these are God's people!
			-	She was so convicted that and ready to take action that she made the statement “if I perish, I perish” (Est. 4:16).
		-	Esther didn't just talk the talk, she walked the walk!
			-	She knew that she could have been put to death for approaching the king without his calling her (Est. 4:11).
			-	She went anyways (Est 5:1-2).
	-	From Esther's continued courage, her people flourished and the her enemies were vanquished (Est.10).
-	The Call of God's Followers Today.
	-	God's followers today (Christians), are called to spread the good news of Christ (Matt. 28:19-20).
		-	This is a scary task to many, but it is the work of God.
		-	It is the work to not only conserve God's people as Esther did, but add more people to His great kingdom!
	-	Like Esther, God's followers today, are to be pleasing to God even to the point of death (Rev. 2:10).
		-	Jesus was faithful to us to the point of death, why can't we be faithful towards God?
		-	To Christians, it should be a blessing be persecuted for the cause of Christ!
			-	The one who is persecuted for righteousness sake are blessed (happy) because of our great reward (Matt 5:10-12).
			-	Paul said it is gain for him to lose his life after his long life of serving the Lord (Phil. 1:21).
	-	A Christian's attitude should be “if I perish, I perish!”


# CONCLUSION:

-	We need to be dedicated to God in the same way that Esther was!
-	We need to show courage as Esther did!
-	Let us remember what Esther did and live how she did with the attitude “If I perish for teaching God's word, I perish,” or “if I perish for doing God's will, so be it!”
