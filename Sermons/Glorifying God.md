Passage:[Psalm 50:23]
# Glorifying God

# We Glorify Him in Praise

- It is undoubtable that we glorify God when we worship Him (Psa 50:23, 86:9).
	- This isn't a comprehensive list of times the psalm writers express the relationship between worship and glorification of God!
	- When we praise him through things such as singing, praying, etc. We are glorifying Him!
- There is a caveat here, in worship, we must praise Him, His way, or it has the opposite effect.
	- We often refer to Nadab and Abihu in Lev 10 to illustrate the necessity of worshipping God in the way He commanded.
	- I would also direct your attention to John 4:24
		- In this lady's mind Jesus was (at least) an established prophet.
			- She asks a question that amounts to "where am I supposed to worship"
			- John 4:24 is Jesus' answer
		- That first word "truth" is just as important as the second "spirit"
			- Throughout Hebrew history, it seems the Jews either had one or both of these wrong.
			- In particular Nadab and Abihu missed the truth and the children of Israel missed the truth when built the calf after escaping Egyptian bondage.
			- Throughout their history, they also missed the "spirit" part.
				- This is a big part of Jesus' Sermon on the mount
				- Hosea 6:6 - they were offering the correct sacrifices, but not with the right attitude.
- We need to make sure we glorify God in our worship rather than denigrate Him by worshipping how we please! 
# We Glorify Him in Teaching


- Notice how John said the Holy Spirit would glorify the Father- by declaring the truth (John 16:14)!
	- This was the work of the Holy Spirit, but we can glorify God in the same way
	- If we use another similar term, it becomes almost obvious - we magnify Him when we teach the truth!
- God through Ezekiel expressed a connection between knowledge of the Lord and glorification (Eze 28:22).
	- The focus was on the fact that they would KNOW God!
	- In this case, the circumstances of them knowing God's power was through His wrath.
	- But think about it, how can we ensure people know God today if not by teaching (Rom 10:14)?
- Again, just as praise in worship needed to be through the truth, so does our teachings - if we want to glorify or magnify Him (Acts 8:32; John 17:17)

#  We Glorify Him in Life

- Christianity is a full time Job!
	- The Christian is to be a Christian from Sunday-Saturday!
	- Of all the ways we glorify Him, this seems to be the most discussed in Scripture
- Much like how we glorify Him by teaching His word (the truth), we glorify Him by living His word!
	- Jesus tells us we're the lights of the world (Mat 5:14-16)
	- We are the to be the lights - as opposed to the darkness we see in the world, we are different (1 Pet 2:9)
	- The world should see the light of the Son shining through us!
- Consequently, other's will turn to God!
	- Have we ever wondered why it is that there was such a huge growth in the church, in the first century when wickedness ran rampant in Rome?
		- Maybe it is because there was a much better contrast between light and darkness
		- People saw the church and wanted to be more like them - a different people!
	- Paul was especially serious about glorifying God through his life (Phi 1:20)
- What about you? Are you glorifying God with your life?
