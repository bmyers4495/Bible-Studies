# Deborah: Mother of Israel

## Introduction

- Today people all over the United States are celebrating some of the most important people in our
society!
- Today perhaps more than ever, our country needs strong mothers!
- It is sad that we have reached a point where motherhood is something seen as weak and not seen as
honorable!
- The Scriptures share a rich history of celebrating great mothers
	- We find mothers who are nurture and care
	- Some of the most beautiful prayers in the Scriptures are from mothers!
	- I wanted to take some time this morning to notice a powerful woman who saved all of Israel
	by being a mother!


- Israel was Ungodly
	- At this point in history Israel had no king; instead God raised up judges to rule (Judges
	2:16)
		- The whole book of Judges revolves around a constant cycle of faithfulness ->
		forgetfulness of God -> punishment -> God raising a Judge to deliver Israel -> back
		to faithfulness.
		- In Judges 4 they found themselves in captivity again (Judg 4:1-4)
	- The first verse in Judges 4 shows they were doing evil in the sight of the Lord
		- This was likely due to idolatry; as the cycle of Judges suggests.
		- They would serve their gods who allowed them to do the things they wanted to do!
	- Our world today is not so different from the date in which we find the Israelites!
		- They were a society that would call what is evil good and what is good evil (Isa
		5:20-21)
		- The Israelites were the "live and let live" types until eventually they became
		exactly like their opposition.
		- It's important to notice exactly how this cycle started!
			- In the beginning, Israel did not drive out all of the folks God told them
			to drive our (Judg 1:28-33)
			- Eventually there rose a generation that forgot about God
			- At this point, they began worshipping the gods of the nations which they
			were supposed to drive out (Judg 2:10-15).
	- Because all of this, Israel has again found themselves in bondage.
		- They were being ruled under the despot Jabin who ruled with an iron thumb!
		- Notice the author states that they had "9000 iron chariots"
		- Later Deborah would recount these events in a song and explain exactly how bad
		Israel had it (Judges 5:6-7a)
			- It seems that Jabin's men were on lookout in the roads and in the city.
			- What a shame for the nation of the Lord!
	-  To sum it up:
		- Israel showed that lack of faithfulness through idolatry.
		- God had delivered them into the hands of their enemies (Judg 4:1-4)
		- Their enemies ruled over them with an iron thumb! 
- Israel Needed a Mother
	- We might do well to notice that there were a couple things which Deborah was!
		- Deborah was a prophetess (Judg 4:4)
		- Deborah was a warrior (Judg 4:8-10)
			- Josephus described Deborah as the general in the battle!
			- When Deborah commands "Up! For the Lord has delivered Sisera...." Josephus
			says that it was at this point that Barak was discouraged by the size of
			their army.
		- Deborah was a mother (Judg 5:7)
	- It is interesting that of all the things Deborah was to Israel, she described herself as a
	mother; and it was that function that allowed Israel to claim victory!
	- Notice the qualities that make might qualify her as a mother of Israel!
		- She was something like a "mother bear"
			- She had seen the direction Israel was going and desired that it changed!
			- Notice in her song, she saw the desolation of Israel!
		- She stood in the place as a confidante for her children which brought them
		victory (Judg 4:14)
		- Along those lines, she was the most instrumental motivator behind their victory
			- I dare say that if it was not for this great mother, they would have
			lost the battle!
			- Her role was arguably the most important!
- We need strong mothers today!
	- Consider for a moment why one of God's qualifications for an elder is that he must have a
	wife (1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:6)
		- They say behind every strong man is a strong woman!
		- Is it perhaps for the same reason that that Deborah was needed?
			- She becomes a motivator to her husband 
			- King Lemuel paints a picture of a woman who sacrificially holds the family
			together (Pro 31:11ff).
		- The elder's household is God's ideal!
	- The evil we find all around us is what happens when man steps further and further away
	from God's ideal!
		- Today, God's ideal for the family is barely visible in our society!
		- Men and women are not the same, we have different functions and both are highly
		esteemed!
	- Both the church and the world need women like Deborah! 

## Conclusion

- We often think about powerful men and their roles in leading and building great nations
- The fact is that the mother plays an integral part in the whole system!
- The most important quality any of us (man, woman, mother, father) can have is fear of God (Eccl
12:13)
