## Introduction

- Of all the topics that cause divisions, the use of the "church money" has to be amongst the
highest on the list.
- Around the 50s, the church witnessed one of its biggest splits in recent history over this exact
topic.
- To this day, we often still have a difficult time discerning how we use the "treasury".
- I want to suggest that the "church money" should be used on some of the same things our individual
money should go towards.
- First, we need to look at a brief description of what the church is, then we can look at what the
church is supposed to be doing.
	- Money fits into this equation because it is one of the tools by which we achieve the works
	of the church

## DISCUSSION

- What is the Church?
	- Throughout the Old Testament, there were prophesies of Satan being defeated and mankind
	being saved.
		- The first example of this is found in the garden (Gen 3:15)
		- After, After this Abraham is promised that his seed was going to be a blessing to
		all man (Gen 12:1-3).
		- So the story of God's law goes and man's salvation has been laid out throughout
		the Old Testament.
	- Jesus said He would build His church based on the confession made by Peter that Jesus
	Christ is the Son of the Living God (Mat 16:16).
		- This bible narrative that leads us to the church comes to fruition in Acts 2 where
		Peter preaches the first Gospel message and people are being added to the church
		(Acts 2:42)
		- It as been God's plan since the foundation to sanctify people through Christ (Eph
		1)
	- So when it comes to the "church's money" we cannot separate the "churches money" from the
	individual's money
		- When we are told to be the light of the world (Mat 5:14), it is a work of the
		church.
		- When we are told to preach the gospel (Mark 16:15-16), it is a work of the
		church.
		- "works of the church" and "individual works" are inseparable. 
		- Money is just one of the tools that we have to further reflect the goodness of God! 
	- With an understanding of who and what the church is and how money is one of the tools by
	which we do the work of the church, we must then look at what exactly is the "work of the
	church" 
- Works of the Church
	- The church must be involved in benevolent work! 
		- Benevolence simply means to do good!
		- The idea of doing good to mankind is often described in the Bible!
			- Consider how Jesus to said He was going to judge man (Mat 25:31-46)
				- The things Jesus listed was about doing good to our fellow man!
				- Each of the things also requires sacrifice (feeding, giving drink,
				clothing).
				- On this account, there will be many leaders and elders who decided
				to store up money who will have to give an account for what they did
				with the money!
			- Paul wrote to not be weary in doing good, and to do good to all man (Gal
			6:9,10).
			- James writes that pure and undefiled religion IS visiting the orphans and
			widows (James 1:27).
		- If we believe God as good and we are to be reflectors of His light (Mat 5:14) how
		could we not use His money to do good?	
		- There is no reason to see the church treasury and how we use our money in terms of
		what will receive the greatest return on our investment!
			- We're not a business, we're a body of believers who are supposed to be
			involved in good works!
			- And if we truly believe God is good (especially to His disciples), why do
			we not trust in His ability to provide if we are doing what we are supposed
			to be doing?
		- Finally, benevolence and evangelism are related, but distinct!
			- The motivation behind our benevolence should not necessarily be to gain a
			"return on our investment" 
			- As we have already seen, we are supposed to do good just because God is
			good!
			- Jesus taught that just doing good should cause mankind to glorify our
			Father (Mat 5:16). 
	- The church also must be involved with teaching God's word!
		- With the definition of benevolence that we just saw, evangelism might would
		technically fall under the same category!
			- Teaching the Gospel is a good work, but good works are more broad than
			teaching the Gospel.
			- We can give food to people who are hungry just to give food to them
			because that is a good thing to do, no other motive.
		- That said, the church has always been involved in evangelistic works!
			- Paul told Timothy to preach the word (2 Tim 4:2).
			- Along these lines, Paul also said that he planted, Apollos water, and God
			produced the increase.
				- This teaches that we can serve in different ways!
				- Not everyone has to plant churches, some are better at "watering".
		- We ought to ensure that those who are in the community has access to the truth,
		not only error!   
## Conclusion

- I have concern for leaders of the congregations who have excessive money in their bank account.
- When the Lord comes back, do we think He will be concerned with how much money we have stored up
or how much good we have done amongst His creation; those made in His image?
- This, by the way does not only apply to the church (collective), this question can be asked of
each of us individually.
