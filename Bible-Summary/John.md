>  [John 1:1-3 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/1/)
>  1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2. He was in the beginning with God. 3. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.

- There has been some controversy over this passage, and perhaps an understanding of the word "arche" (Translated beginning here) can be of some worth.
	- Origen explains this word can be used in various way (see [Origen's Explanation of Arche](../Notes/Origen's-Explanation-of-Arche.md))
	- The Bible student can deduce that Arche is referring to before all creation.
		- Skipping forward to v3, this Being referred to as "The Word" was the creator of ALL things, thus he had to be before all things were created!
		- It can be noted that part of this creation was time, thus "the Word" was before time, or eternal!
- Another point which must be addressed, is that of the word "Logos" (Translated the Word).
	- John's use of Logos was one which the Greeks would understand.
		- There is a long, rich history of [Logos in Greek Philosophy](Philo%20and%20Logos.md).
		- Most of the Greek Philosophers were of the understanding that "Logos" was in some way responsible for creation.
 - By his verbiage, John also reaffirms the Psalmist's position [1](John.md#^References) stated in [Psalm 33:6](Psalms#^Ch33)

>  [John 3:1-3 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. <sup> 2 </sup>This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.” <sup> 3 </sup>Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you,  unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”


- Here were 70 member of the Sanhedrin, and only three were spoken of positively.
	- Nicodemus (John 7:50-51).
	- Joseph of Arimathea (John 19:38).
	- Gamaliel (Acts 5:34-39).
- There are a couple ideas why John chose night, but no clear reason.
	- Perhaps he was fearful of the Jews.
	- Perhaps it was a cultural and evening was the time they'd visit.
	- Maybe it was because it was a good time to have uninterrupted conversation.
- There are two possibilities I can conceive as to whom Nicodemus might be referring to when he says "we".
	- Could this be an admission that the Pharisees knew exactly who He was?
	- Possibly there were more Pharisees who though favorably of Christ.

>  [John 3:3-4 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 3 </sup>Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you,  unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” <sup> 4 </sup>Nicodemus said to Him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”

[Jewish view of "born again"](https://www.chosenpeople.com/a-jewish-view-of-john-3/)

- [[Born Again]] possibly has some implications in the Jewish mind
	- The language is nearly the same as the Talmud's discussion of gentiles being proselyted --> new born.
	- Kings went through a process that rendered them "newborns" ([Psa 2:7](#References)).
	- Another Jewish though of rebirth was in their world to come ([Job 14:14](#References)).
- Despite the significance of new birth throughout the Law and Prophets, Nicodemus was not able to understand to what Jesus was referring.
- Also coincides with Paul's teaching of walking in newness of life ([Rom 6:1-4](#References)).


>  [John 3:5-8 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 5 </sup>Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you,  unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. <sup> 6 </sup>That which is born of the flesh is  flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <sup> 7 </sup>Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ <sup> 8 </sup>The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”

- Born of the water
	- Jesus is referencing baptism.
		- The idea of being "born again" is discussed by Paul in Rom 6 - new creature.
		- In the direct context, Jesus was contrasting physical birth from the disciple of Christ's new birth.
			- There is no indication that they would have used the same idiom as us in referring to the womb as water (i.e someone's water broke).
			- Furthermore, Jesus is clearly speaking in context of one who has already been born physically.
	- Significance of water in John, specifically:
		- John says three times that he baptizes in water (1:26, 31, 33)
		- Jesus turns water into wine (2:1-10)
		- Jesus says we must be born of water and the spirit (3:5)
		- John baptizes at Aenon near Salim because “there was much water there.” (3:23)
		- Jesus promises the woman by the well living water (4:4-28)
		- The lame man wants to get healed in the troubled waters of Bethesda (5:7)
		- Jesus walks on water (6:19)
		- Jesus invites the thirsty to come to him and drink (7:37-39)
		- Jesus heals blind man in pool of Siloam (9:6-7)
		- Jesus washes his disciples feet (13:4-5)
		- Water flows from Jesus' side (19:34)
- Jesus concept of "born of the spirit".
	- The same Greek word is used for "spirit" and "wind" in v 8 (Pneuma).
	- The analogy made is broken down.
		- The wind is not controlled by you, and is around you everywhere.
		- Despite it being all around you and you sensing the evidence of it, cannot see where it's coming or going.
		- You can see the evidence of the new birth, you don't see the inner-working - God's work ([Mat 7:16, 20](#John3))
		- The spiritual rebirth is that of repentance, like walking in newness of life (Rom 6)
	- Perhaps this is a reminder of [Eze 37:1-14](#John3).
		- The wind blew, the bones were made alive
	- Jesus is proving that this isn't some radical teaching which began with Jesus, Ezekiel and Job prophesied about this very same new birth about which Jesus is speaking ([Eze 36:25-27](#John2))!

>  [John 3:9-17 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 9 </sup>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, “How can these things be?” <sup> 10 </sup>Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things? <sup> 11 </sup>Most assuredly, I say to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen, and  you do not receive Our witness. <sup> 12 </sup>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? <sup> 13 </sup>No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, <i>that is,</i> the Son of Man who is in heaven. <sup> 14 </sup>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so  must the Son of Man be lifted up, <sup> 15 </sup>that whoever  believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. <sup> 16 </sup>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten  Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. <sup> 17 </sup>For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.

- Nicodemus should have known at least some about the new birth as mentioned earlier.
- Jesus' response is not uncommon to how He often responded to the Jew's questions.
	- "You err because you don't know the scriptures"(Mark 12:24)
	- "Have ye not read...?" (Mat 19:4)
	- at least 7 times Jesus asks them: "have you not read", but the question is asked to the Jews on several occasions.
- Perhaps he is speaking of the Pharisees in general in vs 11, as they time and time again rejected the testimony of Christ even through the miracles he performed.
	- How can Jesus explain things like the Spirit (which is allusive and can't be seen directly - v8), when they are not even open to learning from the things they have seen?
	- The only one who has seen the heavenly things would be the Son (speaking of Himself). 
- Jesus continues explaining "heavenly" things by referring to another instance Nicodemus should know - Moses raising the serpent in the wilderness ([Num 21:4-9](#John3))
	- Israel sinned, repented, and was restored.
	- The cure for Israel's disease was the serpent, Jesus is the cure for our sin disease.
- The Son being lifted up refers to His crucifixion (John 8:28; 12:32)
- God's Mono-Genes Son.
	- Philo taught a version of the Logos being the "first born of God."
	- Some take this to mean "one of a kind or unique".
		- Mono-Genes, however, is always translated in the same way king James translates (begotten), eg Luke 8:42, Luke 9:38, Luke 7:12.
		- The fact that Jesus was His "only-begotten" son does not necessitate there being a time when God was without Jesus.
	- Moreover, the fact that Jesus is His son is proof that they are " of the same essence" - Jesus is God
	- Read more [here](https://www.christianstudylibrary.org/article/monogenes-%E2%80%9Conly-begotten%E2%80%9D-or-%E2%80%9Cone-kind%E2%80%9D).
- Everlasting life.
	- It is interesting to note that while the other gospel writers use this word (aios) on average 5 times, John uses it 16.
	- There are more ideas on the eternal life a Christian has than probably can be counted.
		- It is exciting to think and theorize on the unknown.
		- Jesus sums up the eternal life we have through Him very simply: "this is eternal life, that they may know You" (John 17:3)
- Jesus' purpose was not to condemn.
	- Jesus' whole purpose from the foundation of the World was to save mankind (Eph 1:4, 5; Isa 43:1-7).
	- As the light exposes the darkness, Jesus' coming into the world does condemn people!

> [!bible]+ [John 3:18-21 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 18 </sup>“He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. <sup> 19 </sup>And this is the condemnation,  that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. <sup> 20 </sup>For  everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. <sup> 21 </sup>But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been  done in God.”


- John is continuing along the same line of reasoning here.
	- If Jesus purpose were to condemn, condemnation would be brought by doing what He said.
	- Rather, following Jesus' instructions leads to salvation and not doing what He says leads to condemnation.
- The light exposes the light, not the other way around.
	- Light is also a common theme throughout John's writings.
	- Those who practice darkness do not want to be exposed by the light (Mat 5:14-16; Eph 5:11).
		- Part of "being the light of the world" is exposing the works of darkness.
	- This also suggests that it is not easy to come to Jesus, as it requires us to expose our evil deeds in the light of Christ; meaning we have to admit to our wrongs!

> [!bible]+ [John 3:22-26 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 22 </sup>After these things Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He remained with them and baptized. <sup> 23 </sup>Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized. <sup> 24 </sup>For John had not yet been thrown into prison. <sup> 25 </sup>Then there arose a dispute between <i>some</i> of John’s disciples and the Jews about purification. <sup> 26 </sup>And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified—behold, He is baptizing, and all are coming to Him!”

- John's imprisonment.
	- The gospel according to John never details John's imprisonment.
	- Remember John seems to be more focused on proving Christ.
- The Jews disputing over baptism.
	- In the Jew's case, often purification was associated with physical cleanliness (eg Num 19).
		- Josephus' opinion was even that it related to bodily purification.
		- The Jews' idea was that the soul's purification was presupposed because it had already been "purified beforehand by righteousness"(Antiquities 18.117).
	- On the other hand, John was preaching a "baptism of repentance for remission of sins"(Luke 3:3).
	- The disciples of John were worried that Jesus was taking some of John's popularity.


> [!bible]+ [John 3:27-30 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 27 </sup>John answered and said, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven. <sup> 28 </sup>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before Him.’ <sup> 29 </sup>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled. <sup> 30 </sup>He must increase, but I <i>must</i> decrease.

- John was not worried about his popularity.
	- This is in stark contrast to other people at the time.
		- The Herods.
		- The Pharisees.
		- The Romans.
	- John realized the popularity he did receive was not of himself.
- If John's disciples were listening, they would know that his whole purpose was to lead them to Christ; not his own glory.
- The friend of the bridegroom - an assistant; not the main participant.

> [!bible]+ [John 3:31-33 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 31 </sup>He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. <sup> 32 </sup>And what He has seen and heard, that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony. <sup> 33 </sup>He who has received His testimony has certified that God is true.

- John is teaching the same thing Jesus did in v10-17.
	- People were not ready to hear "heavenly" things over the earthly things.
		- It seems like this is one of the reasons Jesus chose to speak in parable.
		- Also, John, describing heaven as a place with "streets of Gold"
	- The fact is they were barely able to learn earthly things.
- Jesus was the only one capable and qualified to speak the "heavenly things" as He has seen and heard them!
- Jesus was the "Way, the Truth and the Light".
	- Jesus, Himself, was evidence of God (and maybe specifically God's promises?).
	- Nevertheless, the one that listens to Christ will know the truth of God.

> [!bible]+ [John 3:34-36 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/3/)
>  <sup> 34 </sup>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure. <sup> 35 </sup>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand. <sup> 36 </sup>He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”

- Jesus does not have limited prophecy.
	- 1 Pet 1:10-12 indicates that the prophet didn't fully understand his prophesy
	- Jesus, on the other hand was able to speak the full Word of God, whereas the prophets only spoke pieces as God gave them.
- John was preaching Hebrews 1:1-3 before the book was written.
	- Instead of prophets, John understood God was speaking to them by Jesus now, and John was happy to give place to Him.
	- Not only that, but he seemed to understand that the Father gave all things to Jesus.
	- John's teachings **SHOULD** have prepared the people for Christ.
- Again, just as it was mentioned earlier on, this is a belief that does.
	- Like Hebrews 11.
	- Like those who had to look at the serpent.
- Overall, John the Baptist is reiterating exactly Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus.

# Ch4

> [!bible]+ [John 4:1-4 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/4/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Therefore, when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John <sup> 2 </sup>(though Jesus Himself did not baptize, but His disciples), <sup> 3 </sup>He left Judea and departed again to Galilee. <sup> 4 </sup>But He needed to go through Samaria.

- These who were baptized were still not baptized by the Holy Spirit.
	- John said Jesus would baptize them with "Holy Spirit and fire" (Mat 4:11).
	- Jesus continues His ministry preaching the same thing John did about the Kingdom.
	- Jesus' disciples were practicing the same thing as John's baptism.
- He needed to go through Samaria
	- [Judea-Map-With-Roman-Roads](Judea-Map-With-Roman-Roads.png)
	- [Judea-To-Galilee-Routes](Judea-To-Galilee-Routes.png)
	- It was the custom of the time to go around Samaria (even if it took longer); the route Jesus took seemed to go the long way, but to go through Samaria.

> [!bible]+ [John 4:5-8 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/4/)
>  <sup> 5 </sup>So He came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. <sup> 6 </sup>Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from <i>His</i> journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour. <sup> 7 </sup>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.” <sup> 8 </sup>For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.

- This sets the framing for the rest of the passage. 
	- Jesus is near Schechem
	- There is a lot of Hebrew history regarding this location, but in short, it was a plot of land which Jacob had bought (Josh 24:32)
	- ![Nicodemus-and-Samaritan-Woman](Nicodemus-and-Samaritan-Woman.png)
- John started the book by showing Jesus' divinity, but is now showing His humanity
	- Just like everyone, Jesus got tired, hungry, thirsty etc.
	- The 6th hour was ~6PM according to Roman's time
- As will be noted in the next couple verses, there are several reason's Rabbis would avoid this woman.
	- She is a woman
	- She is Samaritan
	- She was unclean
- It seems maybe His disciples were not even ready for this type of interaction

> [!bible]+ [John 4:9-10 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/4/)
>  <sup> 9 </sup>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, “How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. <sup> 10 </sup>Jesus answered and said to her, “If you knew the  gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give Me a drink,’ you would have asked Him, and He would have given you  living water.”

- It is evident that her first thought was not "wow, how rude", but rather that of shock.
	- It seems that what he is really saying here is that "if you really knew who I AM, you'd be even more shocked"
- We find again a kind of thread that seems to be throughout the book of John, in the representation of water and water's cleansing power.
	- I think this is a reference to Zech 14:8,9
	 - It seems that He is referring to the gospel of salvation, if I am correct in His reference.

> [!bible]+ [Zechariah 14:8-9 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/38/14/)
>  <sup> 8 </sup>And in that day it shall be <i>That</i> living waters shall flow from Jerusalem, Half of them toward the eastern sea And half of them toward the western sea; In both summer and winter it shall occur. <sup> 9 </sup>And the LORD shall be King over all the earth. In that day it shall be—  “The LORD <i>is</i> one,” And His name one.

- As usual, she misunderstands Jesus, and thinks He is referring to perhaps moving water.
	- Physical water prevents death temporarily, living water gives eternal life.
	
> [!bible]+ [John 4:11-12 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/4/)
>  <sup> 11 </sup>The woman said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water? <sup> 12 </sup>Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?”

- Even Jacob drew water from this well with a tool of sorts.
	- She could not think of anyone who could be greater than Jacob
	- Later Jesus will proclaim "before Abraham was I AM" (John 8:58)
- It is interesting that she claimed Jacob as their father as the Jews thought the same.

> [!bible]+ [John 4:13-15 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/4/)
>  <sup> 13 </sup>Jesus answered and said to her, “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, <sup> 14 </sup>but  whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him  will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.” <sup> 15 </sup>The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.”

- The comparisons
	- The water from this venerated well leaves a person satisfied temporarily.
	- The water Jesus offers gives eternal life.
- She still does not quite understand the meaning of "living water"

> [!bible]+ [John 4:16-20 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/4/)
>  <sup> 16 </sup>Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” <sup> 17 </sup>The woman answered and said, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have well said, ‘I have no husband,’ <sup> 18 </sup>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly.” <sup> 19 </sup>The woman said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. <sup> 20 </sup>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you <i>Jews</i> say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.”

- Jesus gives proof of his claims.
	- There is no way he could have known this except he be from God.
	- Jesus knew man's heart and he knew/took interest in this ladies life!
	- This certainly is not Jesus' stamp of approval on her marriages, on the contrary (cf John 8 - cast the first stone). 
	- The evidence was well received by this woman and she believed he was from God.
- Notice Jesus' mode of evangelism here.
	- She knows that He cares for her; because He should not even be talking to her as a Rabbi.
	- He proved that He is from God through evidence.
- Some say this was her testing Him by throwing a "red herring" at Him to distract from her sins.
	- Almost like what the Pharisees would often do in trying to trap Jesus
	- Whether her motives were nefarious or she genuinely needed to know, Jesus entertained the question.
-  Samaritans and their beliefs
	- They only accepted the Mosaic texts - not the prophets
	- They believed that the Messiah would establish a kingdom from Shechem - more specifically Mt Gerizim
		- They are stuck pre-inheritance Deut 11:29, before Israel obtained the land promise.
		- I am not sure how they dismiss Deut 12:9-11
	- Along with Mosaic text, they also somehow affirmed idol worship

> [!bible]+ [John 4:21-24 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/4/)
>  <sup> 21 </sup>Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming  when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father. <sup> 22 </sup>You worship  what you do not know; we know what we worship, for  salvation is of the Jews. <sup> 23 </sup>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will  worship the Father in  spirit  and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. <sup> 24 </sup>God <i>is</i> Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”

- She was missing the whole point by asking this question.
	- Everyone believed that their Messiah would conquer the world for them and make them the "world power"
		- This was not Jesus' goal at all
		- Jesus' response touches on the spirituality of the kingdom more than the physicality
	- Even the Roman's believed in a sort of Messiah that would make Rome a never ending kingdom [^1]

>  <sup> 1 </sup>The hand of the LORD came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it <i>was</i> full of bones. <sup> 2 </sup>Then He caused me to pass by them all around, and behold, <i>there</i> <i>were</i> very many in the open valley; and indeed <i>they</i> <i>were</i> very dry. <sup> 3 </sup>And He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” So I answered, “O Lord GOD, You know.” <sup> 4 </sup>Again He said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! <sup> 5 </sup>Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: “Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live. <sup> 6 </sup>I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.” ’ ” <sup> 7 </sup>So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to bone. <sup> 8 </sup>Indeed, as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no breath in them. <sup> 9 </sup>Also He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” ’ ” <sup> 10 </sup>So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army. <sup> 11 </sup>Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They indeed say, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!’ <sup> 12 </sup>Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. <sup> 13 </sup>Then you shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up from your graves. <sup> 14 </sup>I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken <i>it</i> and performed <i>it,</i>” says the LORD.’ ”

>  <sup> 4 </sup>Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the Way of the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom; and the soul of the people became very discouraged on the way. <sup> 5 </sup>And the people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no food and no water, and our soul loathes this worthless bread.” <sup> 6 </sup>So the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died. <sup> 7 </sup>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you; pray to the LORD that He take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. <sup> 8 </sup>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery <i>serpent,</i> and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” <sup> 9 </sup>So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.


[^1]: The belief was widespread in the world at that time or earlier that the Epiphany or coming of a god in human form on earth, was imminent, in order to save the human race from the destruction which the sins of mankind deserved and had brought nigh. The world was perishing in its crimes, and only the coming of the God Himself could save it. This belief can be observed in various forms during the years that preceded. It prompted the Fourth Eclogue of Virgil and it is seen in the Second Ode of Horace. To them it means the glory and the triumph and the permanence of Rome.
