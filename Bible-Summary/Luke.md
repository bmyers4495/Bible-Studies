>  [Luke 3:1-3 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/42/3/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, <sup> 2 </sup>while Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. <sup> 3 </sup>And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,


- Government arrangement ([Antiquities 18:1-35](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link182HCH0001)).
	- Tiberius was the Emperor (Like our president).
	- Herod (Archelaus) was king of Judea (Like a governor).
	- Pilate was procurator.
		- When Archelaus came into power, he appointed a member of the senate named Cyrenius as a tax collector and Coponius as procurator.
		- After some history and several predecessors, Pilate obtained this same position
		- This position was responsible for taxes and also Jewish-Rome relations.
		- Included in their policy, was at times, they appointed high priests.
			- Caiaphas was the result of the uprooted priesthood.
- John's baptism of repentance.
	- The baptism he was teaching was a bridge of sorts to the baptism of the Christian. (see [Jews view of John's Death](../Reference%20Notes/Josephus-Antiquities#Jews%20theory%20on%20John's%20death))
		- Moses commanded alot of physical purification (ie Woman in her uncleannes ([Lev 12](https://bolls.life/NKJV/3/12/)), Inauguration of the Levites as the Priestly Tribe ([Num 8](https://bolls.life/NKJV/4/8/) ), etc).
		- The Jewish teachings on purification was a type of what was to come ([Heb 9:13-19](https://bolls.life/NKJV/58/9/13-19/)).
	- Note that Luke says John was "preaching" a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins; not that John's baptism brought these things.
		- Otherwise, why did we need Christ?
		- The Hebrew writer argued that we MUST have had Jesus to remit our sins.
		- This was John prophesying of the baptism to come.

>  [Luke 3:4-6 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/42/3/)
>  <sup> 4 </sup>as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying:  “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the <i>LORD</i>; Make His paths straight. <sup> 5 </sup>Every valley shall be filled And every mountain and hill brought low; The crooked places shall be made straight And the rough ways smooth; <sup> 6 </sup>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.’ ”

- John prepared the way.
	- The story of the Bible is that of a sin problem (crooked paths, inequitable mountains, etc).
		- Everything in the law bring us to Christ ([Gal 4:4](https://bolls.life/NKJV/48/4/)).
		- There were things mankind had to learn to be ready for the Savior ([Rom 15:4 ](https://bolls.life/NKJV/45/15/)).
		- John was the middle man bringing us there([Mat 11:11-13](https://bolls.life/NKJV/40/11/)).
	- His message was all directly pointing to the Messiah and His Kingdom.
- Further, "all flesh shall see salvation" is a prophecy of the Gentiles being brought into the fold.
> [!bible]+ [Psalm 98:3 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/19/98/)
>  <sup> 3 </sup>He has remembered His mercy and His faithfulness to the house of Israel;  All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

> [!bible]+ [Romans 1:16 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/45/1/)
>  <sup> 16 </sup>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.


> [!bible]+ [Luke 3:7-9 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/42/3/)
>  <sup> 7 </sup>Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <sup> 8 </sup>Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as <i>our</i> father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. <sup> 9 </sup>And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”

- Broods of Vipers.
	- In other places we are warned of "wolves in sheeps clothing".(Mat 7:15)
	- The statement is a bold one, that is to say that the Pharisees and their teachings were deadly!
- Who warned you of the wrath to come?
	- It seems like perhaps John is directing their attention at the prophets.
	- The prophets often warned Israel of nations that were going to destroy them if they didn't repent.
- Their arrogance stemmed from their ancestry.
	- They had the idea that children of Abraham couldn't be lost.
		- It is ironic in view of History, much like when they said "we have not been enslaved by anyone." (John 8:33)
		- Clearly, the Jewish nation had spent more time being lost; as in the wilderness, the many captivities, etc.
	- John is saying; I am warning you just like the prophets of old, you better repent!
- The fact that they were children of Abraham has done little to protect them from the wrath of God in the past!
- Being a child of Abraham was only significant insomuch, that through them came salvation to all men (v 6)
- Good fruit - fruits of the spirit (Gal 5:22-23)
> [!bible]+ [Luke 3:10-14 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/42/3/)
>  <sup> 10 </sup>So the people asked him, saying, “What shall we do then?” <sup> 11 </sup>He answered and said to them, “He who has two tunics, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.” <sup> 12 </sup>Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, “Teacher, what shall we do?” <sup> 13 </sup>And he said to them, “Collect no more than what is appointed for you.” <sup> 14 </sup>Likewise the soldiers asked him, saying, “And what shall we do?” So he said to them, “Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.”

- In each instance mentioned, John is describing a practical repentance!
	- Zaccheaus restored what he had taken four-fold (Luke 19:8)
	- Paul explained the effects of repentance to the church in Corinth (2 Cor 7:8-12)
	- John is teaching each group that it was necessary (for the sake of repentance) for them to give up on their greed.
- This is a bold teaching from John (and even hard to preach today), but John's teaching is certainly visible in the first century Church.

> [!bible]+ [Luke 3:15-17 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/42/3/)
>  <sup> 15 </sup>Now as the people were in expectation, and all reasoned in their hearts about John, whether he was the Christ <i>or</i> not, <sup> 16 </sup>John answered, saying to all, “I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. <sup> 17 </sup>His winnowing fan <i>is</i> in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor, and gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.”

- Baptism of the Spirit.
	- Here Luke is referring to the apostles' receiving of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:4-5)
	- I am not certain that the phrase is always referring to gifts of the Spirit (1 Cor 12:12-13)
- Baptism of the fire.
	- Some have read "baptism of Holy Spirit and fire" and concluded that "fire" was attached to Holy Spirit. 
	- In reality, these two are in opposition, we do not want to be "baptized in fire"
		- Jesus said he didn't come to "condemn the world" (John 3:17)
		- In the same vein, Jesus' existence and mission did condemn and judge those who are unrighteous!
 > [!bible]+ [Luke 3:18-20 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/42/3/)
>  <sup> 18 </sup>And with many other exhortations he preached to the people. <sup> 19 </sup>But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, <sup> 20 </sup>also added this, above all, that he shut John up in prison.

- John said that it was unlawful for Herod to have his brother Philip's wife (Mat 14:3-4).
- It is clear that John had "backbone".

> [!bible]+ [Luke 3:21-22 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/42/3/)
>  <sup> 21 </sup>When all the people were baptized, it came to pass that Jesus also was baptized; and while He prayed, the heaven was opened. <sup> 22 </sup>And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven which said, “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”

- Why was Jesus baptized?
	- Mat 3:15, Jesus explains that He must do it for righteousness sake 
	- [Justin Martyr's idea of Jesus' baptism](Martyr-Schaff-The%20Writings%20of%20Justin%20Martyr.md#^ref-58809)
	- He was baptized for to show His obedience; He was like us in every way.
- Another clear division of the God head.
	- This one image encapsulates the Father saying "you are My beloved Son..."
	- The Spirit descending as a dove.
	- The Son, of course being baptized.
- The Father was quoting Psa 2:7
	- This should have been an undeniable verification of Who Christ is.
	- Not only were all of these events supernatural, but the quote should have brought the Psalmist's prophesy to their minds.
