# Striking the Right Chord 
## A Biblical Perspective on Instrumental-Free Worship



### Introduction

In the pursuit of understanding and embodying Christian worship, believers often grapple with the
question of instrumental music in their worship services. "Striking the Right Chord" delves into
this intricate topic, presenting a thorough exploration of the historical context and perspectives
surrounding the use of mechanical instruments in Christian worship. Grounded in biblical principles
and historical insights, this article challenges preconceived notions, encouraging readers to
reevaluate the assumed universality of instrumental music in worship. Join us on a journey through
the pages of history and theology as we unravel the origins, objections, and complexities of this
practice, aiming to shed light on a nuanced aspect of Christian worship that warrants careful
consideration and understanding.



### The History of the Instrument in Worship


Before delving into the practice of using mechanical instruments in worship services, it would be
valuable to understand the origins of this practice. At the heart of every practice and doctrine
lies a long history of debates amongst theologians, and this topic is no different.

From a historical perspective, the fundamental question to be asked is: "Did the early church
practice this thing?" It's important to note that this article does not presuppose the authority of
example; that issue will be examined further in this study.

The simple answer to the question of whether the early church used instrumental music is no. A
straightforward piece of evidence for this historical fact is that acapella translates literally to
"in the style of the chapel." Additionally, examining the historic writings of the "church fathers"
(2nd century Christian writers) reveals that they did not unanimously agree on every issue. While
their writings are not inspired, from a historical viewpoint, we can ascertain exactly what they
practiced.

Although the church fathers did not agree on all issues, those who wrote about the use of
instrumental music unanimously condemned it as something that should not be practiced. This
historical perspective provides a foundation for understanding the early church's stance on
instrumental music in worship.

We're lead to the question: "if the first and second century church did not have this practice, when
did it start and what were the reasons?" Toward the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> the Vitalian
introduced the organ into Catholic mass. When Vitalian introduced the organ it was controversial,
and not very well accepted. Despite the initial apprehension towards the organ; its use saw a
gradual increase in acceptance. Interestingly, though the historical use for the instrument can be
traced; there is a scarcity of resources to indicate the reason they chose to incorporate the organ.
On the other hand, there are plenty of historical objections to the adoption of the instrument.

### Historical Objections to Instrumental Worship

Observing modern Christendom might give the impression that the instrument has always been accepted.
Historically, it is utterly clear that the adoption of the instrument in worship was until recently
far from universally accepted. Not only were the church fathers anti-instrument, but also the
fathers of many of our modern christian denominations.

#### Early Christians and the Instrument 

Clement of Alexandria was a former Pagan converted into Christianity. As such, his works dealt
primarily with Paganism. Regarding the stringed instruments in worship, he wrote:

> Let the pipe be resigned to the shepherds, and the flute to the superstitious who are engrossed in
 idolatry. For, in truth, such instruments are to be banished from the temperate banquet, being
 more suitable to beasts than men, and the more irrational portion of mankind.[^1] 
 
He is plainly arguing that from his perspective, instrumental music is for the Pagan, not for
worshippers of YHWH. It is important to note this argument, because it is a commonly assertion used
by many of the early Christians against the instrument in worship, and this article will
eventually elaborate on this case. In the same chapter, Clement writes:

> In their wars, therefore, the Etruscans use the trumpet, the Arcadians the pipe, the Sicilians the
pectides, the Cretans the lyre, the Lacedæmonians the flute, the Thracians the horn, the Egyptians
the drum, and the Arabians the cymbal. The one instrument of peace, the Word alone by which we
honour God, is what we employ. We no longer employ the ancient psaltery, and trumpet, and timbrel,
and flute, which those expert in war and contemners of the fear of God were wont to make use of also
in the choruses at their festive assemblies; that by such strains they might raise their dejected
minds. But let our genial feeling in drinking be twofold, in accordance with the law [^1] 

Terturllian seemed understood Ephesian 5:19 as a refutation against the use of instruments: 

> The command, to sing to the Lord with psalms and hymns, [ Ephesians 5:19 ] comes suitably from him
 who knew that those who drank wine with drums and psalteries were blamed by God [^3].

The early Christians did not often deal with this issue as it was not an issue. As noted earlier,
the use of instrument in Christian worship was not an issue until the seventh century. However, when
they do write about the use of instruments; they are clearly against its use. When discussing the
psalms, they would even allegories David's use of the instrument to teach that our instrument is
that of the heart citing Ephesians 5:19. Again, keep this in mind; this article will return to this
argument.

#### Denominational Fathers and the Instrument

It is perhaps even more fascinating to note that the fathers of many modern denominations [even the
denominations that currently use instrumental music] were strongly against the instrument in
worship. John Wesley, for example is often quoted saying "I have no objection to instruments of
music in our chapels, provided they are neither heard nor seen." John Calvin weighs in with his
commentary on Psalm 33:2 and says:

> But when they frequent their sacred assemblies, musical instruments in celebrating the praises of
 God would be no more suitable than the burning of incense, the lighting up of lamps, and the
 restoration of the other shadows of the law. The Papists, therefore, have foolishly borrowed this,
 as well as many other things, from the Jews. Men who are fond of outward pomp may delight in that
 noise; but the simplicity which God recommends to us by the apostle is far more pleasing to him.
 
 
#### History's Conclusion on the Matter

The main point of this section was not necessarily to showcase counter arguments to the mechanical
instrument. Rather, the purpose is to propose that though the instrument is so widely accepted in
Christendom; it was not always the case. So, the practice of instrument is not one to be presumed,
but it is one that must be defended. This conclusion reached strictly from history will be further
illustrated in the next section which will demonstrate precisely how important worship is to the
Father.

### Critical Nature of Worship

#### God's Expectation of Worship from the Law

Paul wrote "whatever things were written before were written for our learning..." (Romans 15:4a)
speaking about the old law. There are many things that one can learn from the old law including:
what sin is, the genealogy of the Messiah, why we needed a messiah in the first place, and also the
nature of God. If God is always the same (Malachi 3:6, James 1:17), one might expect to see God's
attitude toward worship in the old law.

Throughout the law and the prophets, **worship was of utmost importance**. In fact, the whole book
of Leviticus is dedicated to the tribe of Levite - the priestly tribe (Deut 21:5). This book which
is separated into 27 chapters in the English bible includes very specific laws regarding how they
were to worship, how the priests were to prepare for the rites mentioned [ie sacrifices], as well as
examples of worship that was not pleasing to God. 

Whilst reading through the book of Leviticus, it becomes utterly clear that God demanded very
specific tasks in worship toward Him. For example, Leviticus 3 details how a peace offering was to
be done. He specifically mentions that type - one without blemish (v1), how it is to be slaughtered -
laying hands on the head of the offering at the door of the tabernacle(v2), how it is to be gutted
(v4).

Moreover, it is abundantly clear God's pattern for worship was to be strictly followed, no
exceptions. Notice Leviticus 10, Nadab and Abihu offered "strange or profane fires." The Hebrew word
pronounced 'zer' translated "strange or profane" is usually translated "border," for example:

> Ex. 37:11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made a **molding** of gold all around it. 12 Also he
made a frame of a handbreadth all around it, and made a **molding** of gold for the frame all around it. 

In both verses, "molding" is the same word used in the case of Nadab and Abihu's "strange fire."
This translation suggests that they went outside of what God had commanded them. This is made even
clearer by the Septuagint's translation "allotrios." Thayer comments on the root word "allo" by
saying:

> Synonyms: allos, heteros: allos as compared with heteros denotes numerical in distinction from
 qualitative difference; allos adds (‘one besides’), heteros distinguishes (‘one of two’); every
 heteros is an allos, but not every allos is a heteros; allos generally ‘denotes simply distinction
 of individuals, heteros involves the secondary idea of difference of kind’[^4] 
 
In essence, the word used here suggests that the reason that this offering was "profane" is because
it was an addition to what God had already commanded! Though an understanding of the word serves us
well in the pursuit of understanding what God requires in worship; one does not have to venture any
further than what is said in the English translation. Notice, He clarifies **why** this offering was
not pleasing to God, and it was because this was one "...which He had not commanded them." (Lev
10:1). 

So far, this article has established the fact that God demands His worshippers to worship according
to what He has told them. In other words; He does not want more or less from His worshippers than
that which He has commanded. However, a discussion on God's desires in worship would be incomplete
the heart of the worshipper is not discussed. 

Arguably, the most important thing to God in respect to worship is the heart of the worship. A study
of Israel's history reveals that they had one of two issues; namely with God's commands or with the
heart. The latter, manifests by their treating God's law as checklist completely oblivious to the
privilege they had in worshipping Him - the Creator of all things and the One who delivered them from
Egypt and gave them the promised land. Isaiah notes this exact attitude from Israel in his opening
chapter. 

Notice what God says: "The ox knows its owner And the donkey its master’s crib; But Israel does not
know, My people do not consider" (Isaiah 1:3). In the following passage, Isaiah further elaborates
on the sins of Israel, but notice specifically Isaiah 1:11-13:

> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me?” Says the LORD.  “I have had enough of
burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fed cattle.  I do not delight in the blood of bulls, Or of
lambs or goats.  12	“When you come to appear before Me, Who has required this from your hand, To
trample My courts?  13 	Bring no more futile sacrifices; Incense is an abomination to Me.  The New
Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies— I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting.


Isaiah is very clear when he says: "Therefore the Lord said: 'Inasmuch as these people draw near with
their mouths And honor Me with their lips, But have removed their hearts far from Me, And their fear
toward Me is taught by the commandment of men,'" (Isaiah 29:13).

Studying God's expectation for His worshippers, particularly the Jewish worshippers, is indeed
intriguing. The law sat clear boundaries to which the Hebrew had no right to add anything, nor take
anything away (Deut 4:2). Moreover, God desires His worshippers to have the right heart whilst
performing the correct actions. The assertion that this article will make is that God's desire for
His worshippers has not changed with the transition into the law of Christ.
