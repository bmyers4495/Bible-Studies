# Corrupting the Bible!

## Modern Conspiracies Theories

The idea that the Bible has been corrupted by monks or translators who desire to include their own agenda in the text is amongst one of the most infeasible conspiracy theories to date. A conspiracy theory is just the idea that a group of people are working behind the scenes to push a particular agenda. There are times when they are true, but it requires though one could see the difficulty in successfully conspiring, especially on a massive scale. The more moving parts that are involved with the theory, the more difficult it is to believe. Let's take a moment to appreciate just how many "moving parts" would be necessary to corrupt the Scriptures in a meaningful way.

## Process of Corrupting Scripture

According to [Bart
Ehrman](https://ehrmanblog.org/new-testament-manuscripts-good-news-and-bad-news-2/):
>> We have more New Testament manuscripts than for any other book from the ancient
world—many, many more manuscripts than we have for the writings of Homer, Plato, Cicero, or any
other important author. We have something like 5,700 manuscripts of the New Testament—from
small fragments of tiny parts of a single book to complete copies of the entire New Testament –
in the Greek language in which they were originally written, along with manuscripts in
many other ancient languages (for example, Latin, Syriac, and Coptic).  That is good news
indeed—the more manuscripts you have, the more likely it is that you can figure out what the
authors originally said.

Mr. Ehrman suggests that there are **many** more New Testament manuscripts than these ancient works,
which are generally accepted. With that in mind, it is much more challenging to find -

## Dealing with the Discrepancies

There are subtle differences between manuscripts, but scholars have pretty much settled that most are inconsequential. Of the few differences which are brought forth as relevant to Christian theology, I'd still argue, they are still inconsequential. For example, whether or not John wrote 1 John 5:7 - the Godhead is still consistently taught in other places of Scripture (another topic for another day).
