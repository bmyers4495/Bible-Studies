# Responding to the Watchtower

## Introduction

The Watchtower teaches the physical Earth will be eternal based on a handful of passages, mainly in Psalms and Isaiah. However, the Scriptures teach there will be an end to this physical Earth. 2 Pet 3 is one of the clearest passages to demonstrate this. In an attempt to prove the eternal Earth, the Watchtower wrote an article with the intent of showing that Peter never taught the Earth's end. The goal of this article is to test their arguments and "proof-texts" to determine whether the arguments are logical and the alleged proof-texts not misused;  like the Noble Bereans did with Paul's teachings (Acts 17:11; 1 The 5:21).

## Note on the Proof-texts

Having read many of their writings, one could observe that the proof-texts used to teach their new Earth theory are by-and-large from biblical authors who wrote poetically (eg Psalms, Isa, etc). This is not to say these passages are not important or should not be considered, but it is to say that these passages should be read and interpreted in their local context as well as their general context (i.e. how the original audience would have read). 

## Argument 1

Responding to the question "should Peter's words be taken literally?" The Watchtower writes:

> [!quote] 
> No, they are not. Why not? Because the interpretation of these verses must line up with the context of Peter’s letter and with the rest of the Bible....

Any Bible student should agree with this argument. The interpretation must line up with the context of Peter's letter and with the rest of the Bible. As for the context of Peter, the author mentions it, but never elucidates on how the literal interpretation does not fit within its context. As for the context of the rest of the Bible, we will touch on that a little later.

## Argument 2

> [!Quote]
> A literal view of those texts would mean that the heavens, or universe​—billions upon billions of stars and other matter—​will be consumed by fire because just one speck in its vastness contains wicked humans. Would you destroy miles of shoreline of sand because one grain is not to your liking? That would not make sense! So neither would Jehovah destroy all of his created universe because rebellion erupted on just one of his creative works.

First, this illustration undermines the import mankind has with God. In an attempt to make a point the Watchtower almost takes a deist stance by undermining mankind's significance to God. Man was important enough for God to He make them in His image, love them when they hate Him, and ultimately send His Son to die for them (Gen 1:26, Luke 23:34, John 3:16). So, while the Earth is just a speck in the vastness of all God's creation, it is not obvious that mankind is a speck in terms of their importance to God; on the contrary.

To answer the follow up question, one might destroy a shoreline for a grain of sand, if the shoreline was designed for the grain of sand. The question is not a good representation of the destruction of the Earth, rather, it paints the Earth and mankind as insignificant to God. Moreover, it does not matter how anyone would answer the question as "God's ways are above our ways" (Isa 55:8-9). Man's philosophy rarely matches God's (1 Cor 1:23ff).

## Argument 3

The author claims the literal destruction of the Earth is in direct conflict with the words of Jesus [1](#References): 

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 5:5 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/40/5/)
>  <sup> 5 </sup>Blessed <i>are</i> the meek, For  they shall inherit the earth.

It is worth while to note that both the Greek word "ge" [2](#2) and the Hebrew word "haretz" [3](#3) can, and often are, translated "land". In fact, when Abraham was promised the Canaan land, this Hebrew word was used. 

Consider the history of Israel, and particularly the promise that was given to Abraham and his sons:

> [!bible]+ [Genesis 12:1-3 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/1/12/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Now the LORD had said to Abram: “Get out of your country, From your family And from your father’s house, To a land that I will show you. <sup> 2 </sup>I will make you a great nation;  I will bless you And make your name great;  And you shall be a blessing. <sup> 3 </sup>I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”

As Abram was travelling through Cana, another piece of the promise was added: 

> [!bible]+ [Genesis 12:7 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/1/12/)
>  <sup> 7 </sup>Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” And there he built an altar to the LORD, who had appeared to him.

Finally, after sometime, the promise to Abraham was restated: 

> [!bible]+ [Genesis 17:1-8 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/1/17/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to Abram and said to him, “I <i>am</i> Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless. <sup> 2 </sup>And I will make My covenant between Me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.” <sup> 3 </sup>Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: <sup> 4 </sup>“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations. <sup> 5 </sup>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations. <sup> 6 </sup>I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. <sup> 7 </sup>And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you. <sup> 8 </sup>Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”

Fast forward some 600 years, according to some estimates; Joshua and the rest of the children of Israel are finally entering into the land that had been promised to their father. By the time David comes into the picture, they could have been in the promised land for ~400 years. David writes several poetic songs describing those who will "inherit the land," in particular psalm 37 (Ps 37:9, 11, 22, 29). Again, it is important to understand that David is speaking poetically (and prophetically) through the Psalms. 

One might make the observation that most of the promises to Abraham were realized by the time David wrote this. They (David and the rest of Israel) were in the promised land and Abraham's offspring were a great nation, but in what way "were all the families of the Earth" blessed by him? Perhaps, through poetic language, David is employing metonymy to remind the reader of Abraham's promises that are yet to come.

Moreover, much can be said about the context in which Jesus quoted Psalm 37:11. When reading Matthew's account of this sermon, when Jesus is clearly discussing this physical realm on which all mankind lives, he says: 

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 6:19-21 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/40/6/)
>  <sup> 19 </sup>“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; <sup> 20 </sup>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. <sup> 21 </sup>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


If Jesus was referring to literal Earth in Matthew 5:5 - as something His disciple should desire - why would He tell us not to lay up treasures on Earth in the same sermon? 

Paul teaches that the promise given to Abraham was realized through Christ - Abrahams seed (Gal 3:8; 29). The Hebrew writer sums up the inheritance we have:

> [!bible]+ [Hebrews 11:8-10 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/58/11/)
>  <sup> 8 </sup>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. <sup> 9 </sup>By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as <i>in</i> a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; <sup> 10 </sup>for he waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.

The next logical question should be; has God built an city or kingdom as an inheritance for the heirs of Abraham -- followers of Christ? (Gal 3:8ff)

After Peter confessed that Jesus is the Son of God, Jesus told him: 

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 16:16-19 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/40/16/)
>  <sup> 16 </sup>Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” <sup> 17 </sup>Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah,  for flesh and blood has not revealed <i>this</i> to you, but  My Father who is in heaven. <sup> 18 </sup>And I also say to you that  you are Peter, and  on this rock I will build My church, and  the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. <sup> 19 </sup>And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”

Notice how Scripture uses "church" and "kingdom" interchangeably. Finally, on the day of Pentecost, after Peter had preached that great gospel sermon, the Scriptures say "... And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved" (Acts 2:47).

Thus, the "land" which David and Jesus promised should not be read as literal land, but rather a spiritual kingdom (i.e. spiritual Israel). 

## Argument 4

The Watchtower argues:

> [!quote]
> Would a loving father handicraft a comfortable house for his family only to burn it down? ([Psalm 115:16](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/115/#v19115016)) That would be unthinkable! Jehovah is not only the Creator but also a loving Father.​—[Psalm 103:13;](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/103/#v19103013) [1 John 4:8](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-john/4/#v62004008).

The Psalmist in Psalm 115 plainly contrasts idols (things of this world) to God, to show that God is obviously the one to be praised. In no way does it teach anything about a "comfortable house for His family"; on the contrary, this passage hurts the Watchtower's argument as the "earth" refers to the idols.


## Argument 5


> [!quote] 
> Peter uses the term “earth” in a figurative sense, referring to human society​—in this case _wicked_ human society. Note that Peter draws a parallel with the Flood of Noah’s day. ([2 Peter 3:5, 6](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/2-peter/3/#v61003005-v61003006)) On that occasion, only wicked mankind was destroyed; the earth itself and righteous Noah and his family survived. By the same token, Peter’s use of “heavens” would also be symbolic. In this case, “heavens” refers to human rulership over the ungodly. Thus, the incorrigibly wicked will be gone, as will all wicked governments, which will be dissolved and replaced by God’s heavenly rule, or Kingdom.​—[Daniel 2:44](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/daniel/2/#v27002044).

In mentioning Noah and the ark, Peter reminds the scoffers that people were saying the same thing in Noah's day (2 Pet 3:3-6). Notice also, the different language being used between the world (kosmos [4](#4)) that perished in Noah's day, and the heavens and earth (ge [2](#2)) will be burnt up (2 Pet 3:10). Peter comparing the two does not work to the Watchtower's favor. The world (kosmos) literally perished, just like the Earth will literally be destroyed. 

Further, their prescribed definition of Earth makes no sense with 2 Pet 3:10, which says the Earth and the **works that are in it** (wicked mankind).

As to not belabor the point, Daniel 2 also causes injury to the Watchtower's argument. The prophecy given to Daniel specifies the time in which said kingdom will arrive.

> [!bible]+ [Daniel 2:37-44 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/27/2/)
>  <sup> 37 </sup>You, O king, <i>are</i> a king of kings. For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory; <sup> 38 </sup>and wherever the children of men dwell, or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven, He has given <i>them</i> into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all— you <i>are</i> this head of gold. <sup> 39 </sup>But after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to yours; then another, a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth. <sup> 40 </sup>And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron, inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces and shatters everything; and like iron that crushes, <i>that</i> <i>kingdom</i> will break in pieces and crush all the others. <sup> 41 </sup>Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter’s clay and partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay. <sup> 42 </sup>And <i>as</i> the toes of the feet <i>were</i> partly of iron and partly of clay, <i>so</i> the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile. <sup> 43 </sup>As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. <sup> 44 </sup>And in the days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.

Notice how specific Daniel is in this prophecy. He is clearly identifying a physical earthly kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar. Historically, the nation that conquered Babylon was Medo-Persia, the next kingdom (of bronze) was Greece, and finally the kingdom of iron corresponds with Rome. As Daniel revealed, during the time of the Roman Empire this kingdom would have been established - the same Kingdom which Jesus built (Mat 16:16-19) and the same Kingdom which opened on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) and stands to this day!
