# Where Did We Fail

## Historical Background

In Jesus time there was not much conflict over the existence of a Creator. In the first and second century; this fact was almost self-evident (Rom 15:4). Prior to that men like Plato, Aristotle, Socrates; set the stage for contemporary thought. These men all believed in some sort of god or creator. The issues, nevertheless, were the exact same as they are today. In their day, these, though they "believed" in some sort of god or gods, their purpose was all but clear; they wanted to justify their lasciviousness devotion to their gods included elements like orgies and drunkenness. 

Indeed, no matter where one goes in history; they would find a common thread. From the beginning, Adam and Eve for example, decided against God's philosophy in favor of a philosophy which allowed them to fulfill their own lusts. There were, however cycles in history, where in a certain year; people cared about God's word, then they would go back to not caring. Typically, the part of the cycle in which people loved God's word did not last long. 

Consider the Israelites. When escaping the clutches of Pharaoh, having seen all the great works of God; they praised and glorified Him (Exo. 15:1-21). Three days later, it is as if they had already forgotten the great thing God had done for them and they started to complain (Exo. 15:22-24). So went the story of Israel. They would praise God for a while, then turn around and act as if God never did anything for them.
