# The Resurrection: Extraordinary Conspiracy or Fact of History

## Introduction 

When trying to extract historical facts, it is important to realize that much of the historian's
job is to deduce reasonableness. Specifically, historians deal with abductive reasoning, which is
"having to do with abduction/abductive reasoning. Abduction is a probabilistic form of inference
in which an explanation is offered to justify and explain evidence" ("Introduction to Philosophy",
p.167). Simply put, historians are tasked with explaining events based on the evidence surrounding
said events.

It is important to understand the naturalistic presumption to which the skeptic must hold. In
discussing the naturalistic philosophy of interpreting history, Gregory Dawes wrote: "In drawing
up his account of past events, modern historians do not even consider the possibility of divine
action; the only causal factors they will look for are natural causes." So, when discussing the
possibility of anything supernatural, the naturalist presumes it to be impossible and will attempt
to explain away the apparent supernatural event through various theories. On the onset, the focus is
not necessarily naturalism versus supernaturalism. The main purpose of discussing this philosophy
now is to broadly understand from where these theories emerge.

The naturalist scholar must contend with the abrupt eruption of Christianity in the first century.
The fact that there are several theories which scholars have formulated implies not only that
there is an issue that requires some thought but also that these theories are up for debate.
According to Paul, proving the resurrection of Jesus to be false would cause Christianity to
crumble (1 Corinthians 15:14). Thus, it is essential for the rational thinker to consider reasonableness
in the case for the resurrection and the objections produced by critics.

### Swoon Theory

Proponents of the swoon theory will suggest that Jesus never died on the cross, instead He was put
into an unconscious or swoon state. Within the perimeters of the swoon theory, there are many
sub theories which attempt to explain how Jesus survived His crucifixion and why the Romans might
have taken Him off the cross early. This article will not touch on every proposed sub theory, rather
just the basis of the theory; namely, the likelihood of Jesus surviving the cross.

#### Procedure of Crucifixion in Rome

Those who hold this view of the crucifixion will refer to Marks account of the crucifixion and show
that even Pontius Pilate was even shocked at Jesus' rapid death. Some have said that a victim of
crucifixion could survive up to ten days! Moreover, Jesus' crucifixion followed mostly standard
procedure of Roman crucifixion. Flogging, carrying the crossbar, and being nailed to the cross were
all standard procedure.

On another occasion, Josephus recorded a man by the name Eleazar enduring the same fate which befell
Jesus because of his rebellion against Rome (Jewish Wars ,7.196-203). In antiquities, Josephus
plainly states:"they were whipped with rods, and their bodies were torn to pieces, and were crucified"
(Antiquities, 12.256). In one case the scourging was described as so severe that the man's "bones
laid bare" (Jewish Wars, 6.300-309). 

#### Surviving Crucifixion

Indeed, Josephus records at least one man surviving crucifixion:

> and when I was sent by Titus Caesar with Cerealious, and a thousand horsemen, to a certain
village called Thecoa, in order to know whether it were a place fit for and when I was sent by Titus
Caesar with Cerealious, and a thousand horsemen, to a certain village called Thecoa, in order to
know whether it were a place fit for a camp, as I came back, I saw many captives crucified; and
remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my mind, and went
with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded them to be taken
down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet two of them died
under the physician’s hand, while the third recovered. A camp, as I came back, I saw many captives
crucified; and remembered three of them as my former acquaintance. I was very sorry at this in my
mind, and went with tears in my eyes to Titus, and told him of them; so he immediately commanded
them to be taken down, and to have the greatest care taken of them, in order to their recovery; yet
two of them died under the physician’s hand, while the third recovered (Life of Josephus, 420-422).

#### Problems With Swoon Theory

Despite the contentions of the swoon theorist, it is still unreasonable to believe that Jesus would
have survived the cross. Ironically, swoon theorists often present Josephus' account of the survivor
as evidence to suggest that Jesus survived, but in reality it presents a challenge to their theory.

Titus, the emperor; had the power to command that the victims of capital punishment be removed
prematurely. Such power was not afforded to anyone present in Jesus' case. Instead, it was the
Centurion who was required to be certain of death. Gaye Strathearn notes a quote attributed to
Quintilian: “Crosses are cut down, the executioner does not prevent those who have been pierced from
being buried” (qtd in Stathern 8). Noting that it was a practice to pierce victims of
crucifixion, particularly for those being given to their families for burial. Frankly, a theory that
leans on the idea that a Roman Centurion would not know how to ascertain death is historically
absurd.

Further, in the case of Josephus' companions, note that even with the best care available, only
one of the three survived. How much more unlikely would it be for someone to survive without such care?
It would seem completely unreasonable to conclude that Jesus could have possibly survived the cross.
