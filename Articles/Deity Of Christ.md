## Meaning of Deity

#### God versus deities of the world

Though out history, there have been many supposed deities. With the history man has of deification,
it is quite difficult to nail down a precise definition that encompasses every supposed deity.
Deities have ranged from beings that are just slightly more than super-human to the omniscient,
omnipotent, omnipresent, omni-benevolent of the Bible. 

God is distinct from all deities in several ways. Deities throughout history have been limited in
power, knowledge, and love. In the narrative of Typhon [^1], the gods [^2] fled from Typhon out of
fear. Though there is more to the story it is safe to say, the difference between God and their
gods is established in this very passage.

Yet another contrast between the gods of man versus God is found when the priests of Baal attempt
to go against Elijah and the God of Israel (1 Kings 18:20-40). The point of the narrative
was to present God's power over the power of created gods. 

God has set Himself apart from all other gods through the Scriptures. Moreover, not only did God
set Himself apart, but He has demonstrated why He is distinguished; to the point that there is no
comparison. He defeated the gods of Egypt, the gods of Canaanites, the , and every other god
which man has conjured.

#### God's Nature

It seems fitting that any discussion of God, must be preceded with a presupposition of His higher
wisdom which Isaiah expressed (Isa 55:8-9). In His infinite wisdom, God has given mankind what we
need for life and godliness (2Pet 1:3; Deut 29:29). That is to say; there are characteristics of
God which require a degree of pompousness for one to claim to fully grasp; nevertheless, God has
reveled enough about Himself that man can know what he needs to know.

Perhaps the most important attribute that one must recognize is the "aesity" of God; that is, His
self-sufficiency. God is the creator of **all** things (Gen 1), thus, not dependent on anything.
Melchizedek is clear about who God is when he proclaimed: â€œBlessed be Abram of God Most High,
Possessor of heaven and earth;"(Gen 14:19). The earth is God's possession by virtue of the fact that
He created everything in it. Further, he created the heavenly beings (Job 38:4-7). Thus, there is
nothing on earth nor in heaven which God does not possess; because he created it all.

It necessarily follows that God is eternal. If God created all things and time is one of those
things; God would not be bound by it; in this sense, He is pre-time. Paul taught that many of God's attributes
could be understood through searching nature (Rom 1:20-25). Paul was speaking about the Grecian
philosophers who through a concoction of observation of the earth and reasoning; understood some of
God's attributes, like His eternality. Furthermore, Moses' psalm expresses proclaims His eternality
(Psa 90:2).
