## Meaning of Deity

Though out history, there have been many supposed deities. With the history man has of deification,
it is quite difficult to nail down a precise definition that encompasses every supposed deity.
Deities have ranged from beings that are just slightly more than super-human to the omniscient,
omnipotent, omnipresent God of the Bible. 

Yahweh is distinct from all 



## Deification of the Messiah 

It seems most scholars count **at least 300** prophesies fulfilled by Jesus. The fact is that Jesus
can be preached only using God's law; and that is exactly how the disciples in the first century
preached Him. Consider how Philip preached Jesus to the Eunuch through the prophets (Acts 8:26-35).
This Eunuch, not quite understanding Isaiah 53, was confused in respect to who the prophet was
speaking. Philip was able to take Eunuch from Isaiah to the Christ, no doubt using mainly the Old
Testament and prophecies about Him. With such great detail given to the Messiah throughout the
prophets, one might expect that if the Messiah (to be) is God, the prophets would have discussed
such a matter. So, what did the prophets have to say?
