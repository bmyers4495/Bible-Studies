# Purpose of Repo

The main use for this repository is for my personal study, as it is useful for my personal development and study. My plan is to eventually have a full commentary of the bible based in the repo. This commentary repo will serve as my network of knowledge and will include local links to articles which dig deeper into either etymology or cultural implications and the initial audience might have understood the passage. 

Secondarily, it is my hope that my personal study can be useful for others who are doing the same in attempting to dig deeply into the scripture. 

# Notes to the Readers

- The commentary, though will be included in [Bible Summary](./Bible-Summary/).
- My writing which will be referenced in my commentary will be included in the [Notes](./Notes/) file.
- If you are reading my commentary and see a link to an article that is blank, it might be that I plan to eventually eventually dig deeper into a topic, but haven't yet, as I am trying to focus my study sessions on one topic in particular and you can see my future study plans in [Research Needed](Research%20Needed.md).
