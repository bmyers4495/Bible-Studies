# Origen's Explanation of Arche

## Couple Notes regarding Origen

- It is clear that the Oregon's argumentation was based on the LXX version, in which there are some conflicts when compared to the Hebrew Old Testament, there are more in depth notes [here](lxx-vs-the-Hebrew-Bible).

## Introduction

It can be overwhelming at times to research the Etymology of words in ancient languages when we need only know the strict definition, but also the cultural understanding of such words. Fortunately, the etymology for "Arche",  in particular presents no such difficulty, as [[Origen]] (a 2nd and third century Greek speaker) elaborates on the meaning and particularly, the variety of ways in which Christ could (or could not) be the beginning in the context of [John1:1-3](John#Ch1).

So, what did Origen say was the meaning? To start, it seems clear that Origen understood that arche simply meant "beginning", however the much more pressing matter in his mind was, "the beginning of what?", which brings us to his list of possibilities, namely: 
- [ beginning of a transition](Origen's-Explanation-of-Arche.md#Beginning-of-Transition)
- [beginning of creation](Origen's-Explanation-of-Arche.md#Beginning-of-Creation)
- [beginning of substance](Origen's-Explanation-of-Arche.md#Beginning-of-Substance)
- [beginning of a type](Origen's-Explanation-of-Arche.md#Beginning-of-Type)
- [beginning in learning](Origen's-Explanation-of-Arche.md#Beginning-in-Learning)
- [beginning in design](Origen's-Explanation-of-Arche.md#Beginning-in-Design)

# Beginning of Transition

One example of this is [Proverbs 9:10](../Bible-Summary/Proverbs#^ch9):

> [!QUOTE]
> >  [Proverbs 9:10 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/20/9/)
> >  <sup> 10 </sup>â€œThe  fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One <i>is</i> understanding.

The proverb has to do with a beginning of transition from foolishness to wisdom. In his explanation, Origen discusses this idea in two parts: the length of the road journeyed and the action which puts one on that road.

The **Length of the road journeyed** - the road journeyed being wisdom - is one which King Solomon would have known very well. When comparing the wisdom of the everyday Jew of the time to Solomon's wisdom, it is clear that the everyday Jew would have a  *Long ways to go* to be anywhere near the wisdom of which Solomon can boast.

The **action that puts on the road** of wisdom according to Solomon is fear of the Lord which is the *arche* of wisdom. 

Origen applies this idea using the LXX rendering of [Psalm 16:7](../Bible-Summary/Psalms#^ch16) which states:


> [!QUOTE]
> The beginning of a good way is to do justice.

He argues that at the end of the *road* - the ultimate good way - all enemies are defeated as stated in [1 Cor 15:25-26](../Bible-Summary/1Corintians#^15):

>  [1 Corinthians 15:25-26 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/46/15/)
>  <sup> 25 </sup>For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. <sup> 26 </sup>The last enemy <i>that</i> will be destroyed <i>is</i> death.

Thus, the intent of the good way is to be considered, namely that those who have believed in God on account of His word have one activity left - to know God. Origen argues this is the piece of the road which Jesus repaired, as man has no ability to intimately know God without Christ. It follows that the Word's incarnation is the beginning or arche of a transition into God's good way - the road to our ability to know God. 

# Beginning of Creation

Simply stated, the beginning of creation, refers to anything of this physical word. Origen even goes on to argue the Son is the demiurge or artisan over all that is created in this physical world. Examples of this usage include [Gen 1:1](../Bible-Summary/Genesis#ch1) and [Job 3:8](../Bible-Summary/Job#ch3). 

It is clear that this use of the word arche applies, as [John 1:3](../Bible-Summary/John.md#ch1) states that nothing was made or generated without Him. 


# Beginning of Substance

Origen focuses much less on this use of the word, but states: 


> [!QUOTE] 
> This, however, is the view of those who hold matter itself to be uncreated, a view which we believers cannot share, since we believe God to have made the things that are out of the things which are not


This "beginning" is based on the theory that matter is eternal, thus cannot be held the understanding of arche. This sense of arche can only be counted as truth by those who consider themselves atheists as the theist must necessarily hold a view of the corruptibility of matter - especially the Christian.

# Beginning of Type

This use of arche is related to the English word [archetype](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/archetype) or the more commonly used [prototype](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prototype)which suggests a pattern by which a something is designed. In the same sense that we are "created in the image of God" according to [Genesis 1:27](../Bible-Summary/Genesis.md#ch1).
