## Destruction of the physical world.

>  [2 Peter 3:10-13 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/61/3/)
>  <sup> 10 </sup>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. <sup> 11 </sup>Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner <i>of</i> <i>persons</i> ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, <sup> 12 </sup>looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat? <sup> 13 </sup>Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.

- This passage is not only speaking of the works, it is also speaking of the physical earth.
	- Peter even makes mentions both specifically the Earth and "works that are in it" specifically.
	- Further, Peter mentions the earth and heavens being burned up.
		- Heaven can mean the sky; that which is above earth.
		- Or where God reigns on His throne.
		- This obviously is speaking of the physical heavens.
	- Thus the heavens and earth being burned up indicates there will be a physical end to this world will be burned up.

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 24:35 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/40/24/)
>  <sup> 35 </sup>Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.

> [Revelation 21:1 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/66/21/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.

- There are 2 Greek words we translate as new.
	- Neos - young - as opposed to what is old.
	- Kainos - fresh - not worn and deteriorated.
	- Kainos is used here.
- It is important to note that the new heavens wont be available until the destruction of the old.

- There are no evidence of our physical return to this earth.
	- Jesus says he is leaving this Earth to prepare a place.
	- Jesus ascended to be with His Father.
> [!bible]+ [John 14:2 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/14/)
>  <sup> 2 </sup>In My Father’s house are many mansions; if <i>it were</i> not <i>so,</i> I would have told you.  I go to prepare a place for you.

> [!bible]+ [Acts 2:32-34 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/44/2/)
>  <sup> 32 </sup>This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses. <sup> 33 </sup>Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear. <sup> 34 </sup>“For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself:  ‘The <i>LORD</i> said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand,

## We shall inherit the earth.

> [!bible]+ [Matthew 5:5 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/40/5/)
>  <sup> 5 </sup>Blessed <i>are</i> the meek, For  they shall inherit the earth.

> [!bible]+ [Psalm 25:13 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/19/25/)
>  <sup> 13 </sup>He himself shall dwell in prosperity, And his descendants shall inherit the earth.

> [!bible]+ [Psalm 37:9 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/19/37/)
>  <sup> 9 </sup>For evildoers shall be cut off; But those who wait on the LORD, They shall inherit the earth.

> [!bible]+ [Psalm 37:11 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/19/37/)
>  <sup> 11 </sup>But the meek shall inherit the earth, And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

> [!bible]+ [Psalm 37:22 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/19/37/)
>  <sup> 22 </sup>For <i>those</i> blessed by Him shall inherit the earth, But <i>those</i> cursed by Him shall be cut off.


- It is that the idea of "inheriting the earth" was always to Jewish audience.
	- Matthew's gospel account assumed the audience understood Jewish traditions, not as much so with the other passages.
		- Luke, for example doesn't include "inheriting the Earth" in his account of the sermon on the mount.
	- It is important to note that the Greek word "ge" [1](#1) and the Hebrew word "erets" [2](#2) have a large range of definitions, from the entirety of Earth, to a specific land, to a country.
	- Land and inheritance were keys to Judaism.
		- Abraham was promised an "inheritance" of physical land.
		- By the time of David's writings, they had already long entered the land.
		- The which Moses and Joshua leaded Israel into was simply a type of the promise that all the sons of Abraham have today.
	- Thus, earth or land does not necessarily indicate physical landmasses, but represents the promise given to Abraham regarding his heirs.
> [!bible]+ [Genesis 12:1-3 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/1/12/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Now the LORD had said to Abram: “Get out of your country, From your family And from your father’s house, To a land that I will show you. <sup> 2 </sup>I will make you a great nation;  I will bless you And make your name great;  And you shall be a blessing. <sup> 3 </sup>I will bless those who bless you, And I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”

> [!bible]+ [Genesis 17:3-8 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/1/17/)
>  <sup> 3 </sup>Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying: <sup> 4 </sup>“As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you, and you shall be a father of many nations. <sup> 5 </sup>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you a father of many nations. <sup> 6 </sup>I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. <sup> 7 </sup>And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you. <sup> 8 </sup>Also I give to you and your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”

> [!bible]+ [Romans 4:13-22 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/45/4/)
>  <sup> 13 </sup>For the promise that he would be the heir of the world <i>was</i> not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. <sup> 14 </sup>For if those who are of the law <i>are</i> heirs, faith is made void and the promise made of no effect, <sup> 15 </sup>because the law brings about wrath; for where there is no law <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no transgression. <sup> 16 </sup>Therefore <i>it</i> <i>is</i> of faith that <i>it</i> <i>might</i> <i>be</i> according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those who are of the law, but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all <sup> 17 </sup>(as it is written, “I have made you a father of many nations”) in the presence of Him whom he believed—God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did; <sup> 18 </sup>who, contrary to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, “So shall your descendants be.” <sup> 19 </sup>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. <sup> 20 </sup>He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, <sup> 21 </sup>and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform. <sup> 22 </sup>And therefore “it was accounted to him for righteousness.”

## The Special Class

> [!bible]+ [Revelation 7:4 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/66/7/)
>  <sup> 4 </sup>And I heard the number of those who were sealed. One hundred <i>and</i> forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel <i>were</i> sealed:

> [!bible]+ [Revelation 7:9 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/66/7/)
>  <sup> 9 </sup>After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands,


> [!bible]+ [John 10:16 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/43/10/)
>  <sup> 16 </sup>And  other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they will hear My voice;  and there will be one flock <i>and</i> one shepherd.

> [!bible]+ [Luke 12:32-34 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/42/12/)
>  <sup> 32 </sup>“Do not fear, little flock, for  it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom. <sup> 33 </sup>Sell what you have and give  alms;  provide yourselves money bags which do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches nor moth destroys. <sup> 34 </sup>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


- The scriptures teach one salvation (Eph 4:4-6).
	- We only have one hope, not multiple.
	- Further, there is one body.
		- Eph 2:15-16 - Jews and Gentiles are reconciled into the one body through Christ.
		- 1 Cor 12:20 - many members, one body.
		- 1 Cor 12:13 - baptized into one body.
		- The body is the church, which consists of those who are saved (Acts 2:47)
- They teach that the little flock mentioned in Luke 12:32 is referring to the special class of people [3](#3).
	- Jesus reiterates what he taught in the sermon on the mount to this "special class", namely to set your treasures in heaven as opposed to earth.
		- Earth and Heaven (the heavenly abode of God) are being contrasted here.
		- According to Jesus' logic, things of this earth are temporary; whereas things of Heaven are permanent (they don't decay).
	- The context necessarily needs to be recognized to understand "little flock".
		- Jesus just finished telling them they don't need to be anxious.
		- This passage as the JW explains [4](#4) centered around trusting and God and His provisions. 
		- Jesus was using little flock in the sense of hopelessness -- without God.
			- Micros (defined little) is often used in the sense of stature (spiritual, physical) and seems to carry with it the idea of defenselessness.
			- When Jesus referred to "little" children, he often used this word.
		- To illustrate this definition; replace "flock" with "children".
- Further, they maintain the sheep "not of this flock" proves the multiple classes of people [3](#3).
	- Upon further inspection, this passage is actually detrimental to their doctrine, because Jesus says they will join to become one flock. 
	- Again context would serve us well here, namely to whom is He speaking? - the Jews (v19).
		- Jesus has said that his mission was the lost of Israel ([Matt 15:24](https://bolls.life/NKJV/40/15/))
		- The sheep "not of this flock" are the gentiles who were to be part of God's kingdom ([Rom 1:16](https://bolls.life/NKJV/45/1/)).
- What about the 144000 and the great multitude?
	- There is no separating in the immediate context, when he discusses their being by the thrown  [Rev 7:15](https://bolls.life/NKJV/66/7/).
	- Further this great multitude is said to be before His throne in His temple.
		- The temple is in heaven [Rev 11:19](https://bolls.life/NKJV/66/11/)
		- The throns is also in Heaven  [Rev 4:2](https://bolls.life/NKJV/66/4/)

> [!Quote] The little flock
> Those “who are called and chosen” to rule with Christ in the Kingdom are referred to as a “little flock.” ([Revelation 17:14;](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/revelation/17/#v66017014) [Luke 12:32](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/luke/12/#v42012032)) This shows that they would be relatively few in comparison with the complete number of Jesus’ sheep.​—[John 10:16](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/john/10/#v43010016).

> [!Quote] God's Provisions
> 11 While many Christians may realize the folly of piling up wealth just for their own pleasure and benefit, they may not realize that daily cares can just as easily distract them from being whole-souled in serving Jehovah God. This was the point that Jesus specifically made when turning attention to his disciples, saying:
> “On this account I say to you, Quit being anxious about your souls as to what you will eat or about your bodies as to what you will wear. For the soul is worth more than food and the body than clothing. Mark well that the ravens neither sow seed nor reap, and they have neither barn nor storehouse, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more worth are you than birds? Who of you by being anxious can add a cubit to his life-span? If, therefore, you cannot do the least thing, why be anxious about the remaining things? Mark well how the lilies grow; they neither toil nor spin; but I tell you, Not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these. If, now, God thus clothes the vegetation in the field that today exists and tomorrow is cast into an oven, how much rather will he clothe you, you with little faith! So quit seeking what you might eat and what you might drink, and quit being in anxious suspense; for all these are the things the nations of the world are eagerly pursuing, but your Father knows you need these things. Nevertheless, seek continually his kingdom, and these things will be added to you.”​—[Luke 12:22-31](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978846/13/0).
