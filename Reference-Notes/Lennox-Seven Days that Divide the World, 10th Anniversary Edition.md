## Highlights
Some years after Copernicus, in 1632, Galileo Galilei challenged the Aristotelian view in his famous book Dialogue concerning the Two Chief World Systems. This incident has gone down in history as an iconic example of how religion is antagonistic to science. Yet Galileo, far from being an atheist, was driven by his deep inner conviction that the Creator, who had “endowed us with senses, reason and intellect,” intended us not to “forego their use and by some other means to give us knowledge which we can attain by them.”6 Galileo held that the laws of nature are written by the hand of God in the “language of mathematics”7 and that the “human mind is a work of God’s and one of the most excellent.”8 — location: [205](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=205) ^ref-2040

I recall once talking about the Genesis creation narrative with a well-known astrophysicist, who suggested to me that it was primitive to believe the Bible. To illustrate a point, I wrote on his blackboard: “And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.” He said: “That sounds really primitive. You don’t really believe it, do you? It suggests that God has a physical voice box and speaks like we do.” In other words, my colleague was taking the word said in its primary, natural, human sense – he was taking it literalistically. I laughed and told him that it was now he who was being primitive. Of course God, who is spirit, doesn’t have a physical voice box, but he can communicate. In other words, the expression “and God said” denotes real, literal communication, but we do not have the slightest idea as to how it is done. — location: [330](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=330) ^ref-31837

Genesis 1 can't be fully understood as literal, could it?

The Galileo incident, therefore, teaches us we should be humble enough to distinguish between what the Bible says and our interpretations of it. — location: [492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=492) ^ref-18294

---
If, therefore, we can learn things about God as Creator from the visible universe, it is surely incumbent upon us to use our God-given minds to think about what these things are, and thus to relate God’s general revelation in nature to his special revelation in his Word, so that we can rejoice in both. — location: [508](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=508) ^ref-14620

An illustration may help us understand the difference between these two kinds of order. If a builder is describing how his company built a hospital, he will probably describe the process chronologically: “We dug a hole, laid foundations, and then put up the superstructure floor by floor: basement, car park; ground floor, administration; first floor, wards; second, operating theatres; third, more wards.” But ask the surgeon to describe the construction of the hospital, and he might say: “We put the operating theatre on the second floor and located wards above and below it on the first and third floors.” The surgeon describes the hospital logically from his perspective, not chronologically. — location: [770](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=770) ^ref-40364

---
What then should we think of the different interpretations? Well, the first thing we should note is that they are different interpretations of the same text. That much is obvious. Secondly, the very fact that they are each held by godly, thoughtful Christians who are agreed on all the central doctrines of Scripture shows us that the interpretation of the days is not a central doctrine. There is room for difference of opinion, and we need to show humility and grace when dealing with those who disagree with us. — location: [822](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=822) ^ref-19529

---
The word day, therefore, has several distinct meanings in the short text of Genesis 1:1–2:4 alone. Each of these meanings is familiar from ordinary usage. They are all natural, primary, literal meanings, each referring to something real and perfectly comprehensible. — location: [884](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=884) ^ref-38300

---
In other words, quite apart from any scientific considerations, the text of Genesis 1:1, in separating the beginning from day 1, leaves the age of the universe indeterminate. — location: [914](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=914) ^ref-52804

The overall situation is beginning to look very similar to that of the fixed-earth controversy. There we saw that, although Scripture could be understood as teaching that the earth did not move, it didn’t have to be. Similarly, although Scripture could be understood as teaching that the earth is young, it does not have to be. — location: [918](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=918) ^ref-47801

---
The New Testament does not mention the days of Genesis, let alone comment on their length. Yet it makes a number of important statements on creation that resonate with Genesis 1 – John 1:1, Hebrews 1:3, and Hebrews 11:3, in particular – and emphasize that all things were made by the word of God. — location: [922](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=922) ^ref-32397

---
“And God said.” They each involve a creative or organizational fiat51 of God’s word. Therefore, the fact of what happens in each day – God speaks – is much more important than each day’s length. — location: [925](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=925) ^ref-47176

---
That core message is important for our culture: God, the Word, is primary; matter, energy, the universe, and life are derivative. We might say that creation is “word-based.” It consists of a sequence of speech acts in each of which God injected a new level of information and energy into what is an open system in order to advance creation to its next level of form and complexity.52 This, it should be noted, is the exact opposite of a mindless, unguided naturalistic process, Darwinian or otherwise. Not only that, but the idea that information is primary is central to modern physics and biology.53 More importantly still, since it is word-based, the universe has meaning. — location: [928](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=928) ^ref-23830

---
Thus, and I am wording this carefully, as far as Scripture is concerned, you do not get from the inorganic to the organic without “And God said.” — location: [935](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=935) ^ref-29109

---
The point of the repetition of “And God said” in day 3 is to underline that life did not come from nonlife simply by processes of development. Life required not only pre-existent matter but also a special creative word of God. — location: [941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=941) ^ref-49891

---
What is important is that on each of the days, God spoke – which is not a description of a natural, unguided process. — location: [1005](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1005) ^ref-5560

Here, then, is the Genesis Enigma: The opening page of Genesis is scientifically accurate but was written long before the science was known. How did the writer of this page come to write this creation account? . . . I must admit, rather nervously as a scientist averse to entertaining such an idea, that the evidence that the writer of the opening page of the Bible was divinely inspired is strong. I have never before encountered such powerful, impartial evidence that the Bible is the product of divine inspiration. — location: [1030](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1030) ^ref-19155

Genesis tells us about familiar things: the heavens and the earth, day and night, and the working week. Then it talks about strange things that do not fit with our experience, like light and vegetation appearing before the sun appears. The order strikes us as rather incongruous, even without taking into account any chronology derived from the fossil record – the incongruity is in Genesis itself. — location: [1093](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1093) ^ref-29101

---
The striking demotion of the status of the sun leads us to suspect that the author of Genesis is engaged in teaching something besides what came first and what came next, that the sequence of creatures may not be primarily an effort to tell a historical or temporal story. Instead, the apparently temporal order could be an image for the ontological order; the temporal sequence of comings into being could be a vivid literary vehicle for conveying the intelligible and hierarchic order of the beings that have come to be and are. We need a second, and different, look at the biblical sequence. — location: [1110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1110) ^ref-49293

---
He continues: “Having begun to attend not to the temporality but to the logic – or intelligibility – of the sequence, we are in a position to determine the utterly logical and intelligible structure of the entire account. The main principles at work in the creation are place, separation, motion, and life, but especially separation and motion.” — location: [1119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1119) ^ref-51051

---
we do not constantly have to look over our shoulders to squeeze a temporal sequence into a scientific mold, nor do we have to squeeze science to fit into a preconceived biblical mold. — location: [1132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1132) ^ref-16501

Properly understood, Genesis justifies the scientific experience of unity and order in nature. — location: [1137](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1137) ^ref-47826

---
We all must face the fact that this is a complex and sophisticated text open to multiple interpretations. I, therefore, reiterate that the fact that Jewish commentators, the early church fathers, and all other serious interpreters have difficulties with the text should give us some comfort and make us humbler. It should also show us that the difficulties are by no means all generated by attempted reconciliations with modern science but arise from attempts to understand the text in its own right. My objective here is to try to make clear what the central message is and to stimulate thought about more peripheral issues. — location: [1145](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1145) ^ref-24092

It will first mean the death of fellowship with God, and the first result of this death is a pathetic attempt to hide from God in the garden. The deadly rupture of fellowship with God will then lead inexorably to all the other levels of death – aesthetic death, death of human relationships, and so on, until we reach the lowest level of death, which turns our bodies back to molecules of dust. — location: [1551](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1551) ^ref-56225

We note that the serpent is to have offspring that will be opposed to the offspring of the woman. The offspring are not literal snakes, however. Jesus tells us who they are. He once said to bigoted religious people who were accusing him: “You are of your father the devil” (John 8:44). The offspring of the serpent were human beings who adopt Satan’s hatred of God. — location: [1556](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1556) ^ref-49137

That is, the promise here is not simply that God will triumph – that was never in doubt. It is that humanity will triumph in Jesus Christ. — location: [1562](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1562) ^ref-13586

1. The current scientific evidence for an ancient earth. 2. The honest and admirable admission of prominent young-earth creationists that “recent creationists should humbly agree that their view is, at the moment, implausible on purely scientific grounds. They can make common cause with those who reject naturalism, like old earth creationists, to establish their most basic beliefs.”35 3. The fact that Genesis, though it could be interpreted in terms of a young earth, does not require such an interpretation. There are other possible interpretations in terms of an ancient earth that do not compromise the authority of Scripture. 4. The fact that we do not know everything. Humility is often seen in the greatest scientists. It is also a foundational Christian virtue. — location: [1667](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=1667) ^ref-7663

For when scientific evidence began to indicate that the universe had not existed eternally, some leading scientists put up fierce resistance because they thought it would give too much support to those who believed in creation! — location: [2334](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=2334) ^ref-47096

Genesis 2 account has nothing to do with the original creation of plant life on day 3, but rather he is saying that at a particular time of the yearly cycle in a particular land, before the plants had started to grow, God created human beings.2 Now, this reading of the text clearly assumes that the cycle of nature has been established long enough for it to be relevant, so that in order to harmonize it with the events of day 6, one must conclude, as Collins points out, either that the creation days of Genesis 1 are not (all) ordinary, or that they are separated in time. He regards the first of these two options as preferable, viewing the days as God’s workdays, so that how long they are does not affect the act of communication. — location: [2432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=2432) ^ref-13534

---
Another suggestion that has been made is that the order in the first creation account is principally chronological, whereas in the second it is principally logical. Indeed, in ordinary speech and writing, we often mix logical order with chronological order without necessarily being aware of it. Jim bought a car. He drove it home. You ask where he keeps it. Well, he built a garage to put it in. He built the garage when he brought it home? No, the garage was actually already there. That fact could have been made clearer in English by using the pluperfect tense “he had built” rather than using the simple past tense “he built.” — location: [2445](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=2445) ^ref-52157

The very concept of the Sabbath implies that God’s providence in maintaining the universe in existence does not exhaust what the Bible means by creation. — location: [2487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=2487) ^ref-50349

The catch is that the nature of life itself strongly militates against there ever being a purely naturalistic theory of life’s origin. There is an immense gulf between the nonliving and the living that is a matter of kind, not simply of degree. It is like the gulf between the raw materials paper and ink, on the one hand, and the finished product of paper with writing on it, on the other. Raw materials do not self-organize into linguistic structures. Such structures are not “emergent” phenomena, in the sense that they do not appear without intelligent input. — location: [2721](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=2721) ^ref-28627

Nobel laureate physicist Robert Laughlin, whose research is on the properties of matter that make life possible, issued the following warning to scientists about the dangers of this kind of thinking: Much of present-day biological knowledge is ideological. A key symptom of ideological thinking is the explanation that has no implications and cannot be tested. I call such logical dead ends antitheories because they have exactly the opposite effect of real theories: they stop thinking rather than stimulate it. Evolution by natural selection, for instance, which Charles Darwin originally conceived as a great theory, has lately come to function as an antitheory, called upon to cover up embarrassing experimental shortcomings and legitimize findings that are at best questionable and at worst not even wrong. Your protein defies the laws of mass action? Evolution did it! Your complicated mess of chemical reactions turns into a chicken? Evolution! The human brain works on logical principles no computer can emulate? Evolution is the cause! — location: [2864](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08ZMDBWFM&location=2864) ^ref-1222
