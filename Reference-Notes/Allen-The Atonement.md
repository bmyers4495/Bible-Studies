## Highlights
As Martin Hengel explains, Christianity’s message fundamentally differed from the customary conceptions of atonement in the ancient world. Rather than being offered for individual crimes, the atonement dealt with the universal guilt for all humanity. God’s grace appeared, not as the heroic actions of a particular man but from God Himself through the unique God-man, Jesus Christ. Also distinct from first-century culture was the eschatological character of the atonement. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=305) ^ref-27633

Does God desire the salvation of all people equally? •Does God have a universal saving will for all people? •Does God in eternity past purpose that Christ should save only a select group of people, the elect? •What is the relation of election to the atonement? •Does God purpose that Christ should die for the sins of all people? •Does God’s intent in the atonement necessarily have a bearing upon the extent of the atonement? — location: [368](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=368) ^ref-19816

The word indicates objective reconciliation with all humanity in the sense that the removal of all legal barriers between sinful humanity and God renders humanity to be “savable.” — location: [664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=664) ^ref-19264

Objectively considered, reconciliation focuses on God’s attitude toward sinners—i.e., He is willing to delay sin’s punishment of the sinner; subjectively, God is willing to be reconciled to all sinners who meet His condition of faith in Christ. — location: [705](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=705) ^ref-9082

Atonement is the ground of redemption applied and of salvation; redemption in the sense of the actual forgiveness of sins is the result of atonement applied by the Holy Spirit. — location: [714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=714) ^ref-30061

Atonement was a finished act on the cross; redemption occurs at the moment a person is granted the benefits of the atonement via regeneration by the Holy Spirit.10 Sometimes theologians use “atonement” to refer to the fact of reconciliation as a completed act in the sense of finally having been accomplished at regeneration (i.e., it is complete on God’s part and the individual’s part). In this sense, atonement includes the prior work of Christ on the cross coupled with the person’s response of exercising faith in Christ, which results in salvation. — location: [717](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=717) ^ref-57352

Soteriology is the theological term that defines and describes the work of Christ with respect to how He saves, as distinguished from Christology, which addresses the person and nature of Christ. — location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=728) ^ref-41436

Anselm rightly said that only man should make the sacrifice for his sins because he is the offender, but only God could make the sacrifice for sins since He has demanded it. Jesus, as God and man, is the only Savior in whom the “should” and the “could” are united. — location: [732](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=732) ^ref-44152

---
Salvation is grounded in atonement. Atonement is the basis for salvation. The noun “salvation” connotes the act of saving someone from sin and the resultant state of being saved. Theologically speaking, salvation denotes deliverance from divine wrath, sin, and spiritual death, along with the bestowal of eternal life on the sinner who believes in Jesus, including all spiritual blessings temporal and eternal. — location: [749](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=749) ^ref-41447

We can have no true theology that does not have the cross at its center. We can have no true salvation apart from atonement. Only at the cross do we learn who God is; only at the cross do we learn who Jesus is; only at the cross do we learn the sinners we are; and only at the cross do we learn what redemption and salvation are all about. — location: [761](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=761) ^ref-22000

One question is whether the OT sacrifices secured God’s grace and forgiveness or merely declared such to be the case. — location: [781](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=781) ^ref-2519

New Testament authors employ four different Greek terms for “redemption.” 1.Agorazō is a commercial term that originally denoted the act of making a purchase in the marketplace. This word occurs in 1 Cor 6:20; 7:23; 2 Pet 2:1; Rev 5:9; 14:3–4. 2.Exagorazō—This word’s prepositional prefix (“ex-”) indicates purchase with a price that liberates. This word is used in Gal 3:13; 4:5. 3.Lutroō connotes the act of liberating by means of the payment of a ransom price. The word occurs in Luke 24:21; Titus 2:14; 1 Pet 1:18. The noun form lutron occurs in two key Gospel texts—Matt 20:28 and Mark 10:45. The nominal form lutrosis occurs three times—in Luke 1:68; 2:38; and Heb 9:12. 4.Apolutrōsis, which is akin to lutroō, means to effect release by payment of a ransom.20 This term occurs in Luke 21:28; Rom 3:24; 8:23; 1 Cor 1:30; Eph 1:7, 14; 4:30; Col 1:14; and Heb 9:15. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=794) ^ref-39280

The Son gives Himself “for us.” 2.The Son gives Himself for us by exchanging places with us. 3.The Son saves us from something (sets us free). 4.The Son saves us for participation in the life of God. 5.The Son accomplishes this out of obedience to the Father, who initiated the entire process motivated by His love. — location: [847](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=847) ^ref-8574

True worship of God must be based on atonement for sin. Exodus 24:5 stipulates the sacrifice of animals and the significance of the shedding of blood. The substitution of the animal for the worshiper indicates that the sacrifice was vicarious and penal. The death of the animal, signified by the shed blood, became the medium of sin’s expiation and forgiveness. — location: [981](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=981) ^ref-18014

First, where God is the subject, kipper can mean “forgive.” However, in some texts, kipper is distinct from forgiveness and is a prerequisite to it (Lev 4:20, 26, 31; 19:22; Num 15:25). Nevertheless, the notion of forgiveness is prominent. Second, the word can connote “cleansing” as in Lev 16:30.13 Third, kipper can mean “ransom,” as does its cognate kopher (e.g., Exod 30:12). In the Day of Atonement ritual, the life of the animal is substituted for human lives. Fourth, the word can refer to the averting of God’s wrath. — location: [1027](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=1027) ^ref-42665

Calvin’s comment on this verse is interesting: “On him [Christ] was laid the guilt of the whole world.”32 Calvin also stated, “God is satisfied and appeased, for he bore all the wickedness and all the iniquities of the world.”33 As I have demonstrated elsewhere, Calvin himself held to unlimited atonement. — location: [1130](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=1130) ^ref-49284

Both Isaiah and Jeremiah are at pains to show that the Mosaic covenant with its Levitical sacrificial system was inadequate to secure the salvation of the people of Israel (Isa 1:11–15; Jer 31:31–33). — location: [1232](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07PGFFL9J&location=1232) ^ref-54258
