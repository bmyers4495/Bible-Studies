## Highlights
We gain nothing by bringing God’s revelation into accordance with today’s science. In contrast, it makes perfect sense that God communicated his revelation to his immediate audience in terms they understood. — location: [185](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=185) ^ref-18090

In the ancient world, what was most crucial and significant to their understanding of existence was the way that the parts of the cosmos functioned, not their material status. — location: [323](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=323) ^ref-24596

---
Creation thus constituted bringing order to the cosmos from an originally nonfunctional condition. — location: [432](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=432) ^ref-42952

---
Consequently, to create something (cause it to exist) in the ancient world means to give it a function, not material properties. We need to note the contrast: we tend to think of the cosmos as a machine and argue whether someone is running the machine or not. The ancient world viewed the cosmos more like a company or a kingdom. — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=435) ^ref-51130

---
When the ancient texts talk about how something functions in an ordered system, the system under discussion is not a cosmic or ecological system. It is a system inhabited by beings. In the ancient Near East the functions were focused on the gods, who had created everything to work for their benefit and under their authority. In the Old Testament God has no needs and focuses functionality around people. — location: [842](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=842) ^ref-15542

---
So on day one God created the basis for time; day two the basis for weather; and day three the basis for food. These three great functions—time, weather and food—are the foundation of life. If we desire to see the greatest work of the Creator, it is not to be found in the materials that he brought together—it is that he brought them together in such a way that they work. — location: [960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=960) ^ref-8105

---
It has already been mentioned that whereas in the rest of the ancient world creation was set up to serve the gods, a theocentric view, in Genesis, creation is not set up for the benefit of God but for the benefit of humanity—an anthropocentric view. Thus we can say that humanity is the climax of the creation account. Another contrast between Genesis and the rest of the ancient Near East is that in the ancient Near East people are created to serve the gods by supplying their needs. That is, the role of people is to bring all of creation to deity—the focus is from inside creation out to the gods. In Genesis people represent God to the rest of creation. — location: [1091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1091) ^ref-28730

In days four to six the functionaries of the cosmos are installed in their appropriate positions and given their appropriate roles. Using the company analogy, they are assigned their offices (cubicles), told to whom they will report, and thus given an idea of their place in the company. Their workday is determined by the clock, and they are expected to be productive. Foremen have been put in place, and the plant is now ready for operation. But before the company is ready to operate, the owner is going to arrive and move into his office. — location: [1128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1128) ^ref-32451

What does divine rest entail? Most of us think of rest as disengagement from the cares, worries and tasks of life. What comes to mind is sleeping in or taking an afternoon nap. But in the ancient world rest is what results when a crisis has been resolved or when stability has been achieved, when things have “settled down.” — location: [1142](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1142) ^ref-32883

To review then, the courtyard represented the cosmic spheres outside of the organized cosmos (sea and pillars). The antechamber held the representations of lights and food. The veil separated the heavens and earth—the place of God’s presence from the place of human habitation.[12] — location: [1292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1292) ^ref-46756

---
In short, by naming the functions and installing the functionaries, and finally by deity entering his resting place, the temple comes into existence—it is created in the inauguration ceremony. — location: [1384](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1384) ^ref-5961

---
At this point a very clear statement must be made: Viewing Genesis 1 as an account of functional origins of the cosmos as temple does not in any way suggest or imply that God was uninvolved in material origins—it only contends that Genesis 1 is not that story. To the author and audience of Genesis, material origins were simply not a priority. — location: [1482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1482) ^ref-64810

Divine intention must not be held hostage to the ebb and flow of scientific theory. Scientific theory cannot serve as the basis for determining divine intention. — location: [1600](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1600) ^ref-4351

Their scientific scenarios have proven extremely difficult for most scientifically trained people to accept. When the latter find YEC science untenable, they have too often concluded that the Bible must be rejected. — location: [1647](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1647) ^ref-32107

---
Taking the text seriously is not expressed by correlating it with modern science; it is expressed by understanding it in its ancient context. — location: [1664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1664) ^ref-17414

---
This book has proposed, instead, that Genesis 1 was never intended to offer an account of material origins and that the original author and audience did not view it that way. In fact, the material cosmos was of little significance to them when it came to questions of origins. In this view, science cannot offer an unbiblical view of material origins, because there is no biblical view of material origins aside from the very general idea that whatever happened, whenever it happened, and however it happened, God did it. — location: [1699](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=1699) ^ref-33253

If we have to be reminded or coerced to observe it, it ceases to serve its function. Sabbath isn’t the sort of thing that should have to be regulated by rules. It is the way that we acknowledge that God is on the throne, that this world is his world, that our time is his gift to us. It is “big picture time.” And the big picture is not me, my family, my country, my world, or even the history of my world. The big picture is God. If the sabbath has its total focus in recognition of God, it would detract considerably if he had to tell us what to do. Be creative! Do whatever will reflect your love, appreciation, respect and awe of the God of all the cosmos. (This is the thrust of Is 58:13-14.) Worship is a great idea, but it can’t be mechanical, and it may only be the beginning. It is up to the individual to determine his or her personal response to give the honor that is due. The more gratitude we feel toward God and the more we desire to honor him, the more the ceremonies will mean and the more we will seek out ways to observe the sabbath. All of this derives from a renewed understanding of the sabbath that proceeds from our interpretation of Genesis 1. — location: [2163](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=2163) ^ref-37100

When we are troubled by the disorder that we encounter in this world, it is important to understand that the disorder and brokenness of this world are the result of human sin and the Fall. The theological commitment we draw from Genesis 1 is that God is the author of order. We respond by understanding how he has ordered the world: materially, functionally and spiritually. — location: [2181](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=2181) ^ref-21948

---
Through Genesis 1 we come to understand that God has given us a privileged role in the functioning of his cosmic temple. He has tailored the world to our needs, not to his (for he has no needs). It is his place, but it is designed for us and we are in relationship with him. — location: [2188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=2188) ^ref-63923

---
The cosmos declares God’s glory, and his existence can be deduced in the observation of the world, but those truths do not indicate that his attributes are consistently worked out in what we call the “natural world.” Gravity is not just; rain falls on the righteous and unrighteous alike , even where no one lives (Job 38:25-27); the created world is not “fair.” If it were going to be consistently fair and just, there would be no room for sin at all. Given that it is a sinful world, God’s condescending grace reigns. — location: [2200](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=2200) ^ref-2269

---
We must keep in mind that we are presumptuous if we consider our interpretations of Scripture to have the same authority as Scripture itself. Nobody is an infallible interpreter, and we must always stand ready to reconsider our interpretations in light of new information. — location: [2443](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B003VM8QK0&location=2443) ^ref-32846
