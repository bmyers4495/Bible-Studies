## Highlights
1. We must be good listeners. — location: [214](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=214) ^ref-50213

---
3. We must be reasonable. God Himself is a reasonable being (Isaiah 1:18). — location: [224](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=224) ^ref-19697

---
4. We must avoid offense. We can be eloquent in our defense of Christianity. We can be accurate in our description of the gospel of salvation. But if—in our eloquence and accuracy—we carelessly bring offense in the process of evangelizing, the person to whom we are speaking will likely turn away. — location: [228](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=228) ^ref-25350

---
One thing I love about this book is that the Geislers help us to see that every evangelistic encounter will bring different results. In some cases, you’ll just plant a seed. (You’ll start a person thinking in the right direction.) In other cases, you might just water that seed (with further evidence for Christianity). In some cases, you might even get to see the flower blossom (when the person becomes a Christian). Just planting a seed ought not cause discouragement. As the Geislers put it, “We are not called to bring all persons to Christ but simply to bring Christ to all persons.” — location: [245](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=245) ^ref-5560

---
First, there is less and less interest in the Gospel message itself. Consequently, Christians today find their traditional approaches to evangelism somewhat limiting. — location: [317](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=317) ^ref-19135

---
The second reason we need to develop a new model of evangelism is that the world we live in has changed in ways that often create barriers to the Gospel. The world today can be characterized by a rejection of moral absolutes, a deep religious skepticism, and an indifference or outright rejection of objective truth. — location: [339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=339) ^ref-25317

---
Cultural anthropologist Gene Veith says, “It is hard to proclaim the forgiveness of sins to people who believe that, since morality is relative, they have no sins to forgive… — location: [346](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=346) ^ref-57873

---
It is especially difficult to share Christ with those who have been brought up in an atmosphere of relativism. An increasing number of non-Christians regard our message as irrelevant, judgmental, or no better than any other perspective. — location: [355](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=355) ^ref-65240

---
We also live in a world that is becoming increasingly more skeptical about objective truth, especially religious truth. — location: [367](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=367) ^ref-4047

---
What is pre-evangelism? If evangelism is planting seeds of the Gospel, then pre-evangelism is tilling the soil of people’s minds and hearts to help them be more willing to listen to the truth (1 Corinthians 3:6). — location: [427](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=427) ^ref-30541

---
In reality, we must do more than soften the soil; we must change the condition of the soil so that the soil becomes “good soil” (Mark 4:8). — location: [435](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=435) ^ref-40319

---
Unfortunately, there are some (primarily in the East) who may even believe that mankind’s problem is that we have forgotten that we are ourselves god rather than we have fallen short of the standards of a holy God. — location: [446](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=446) ^ref-60947

---
The apostle Paul said, “I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow” (1 Corinthians 3:6). You and I may not be able in one conversation to share the entire Gospel with our nonbelieving friends and then invite them to trust Christ. But we may be able to help them take a step closer to the cross with each encounter. — location: [468](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=468) ^ref-31793

We are not called to bring all persons to Christ but simply to bring Christ to all persons. — location: [479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=479) ^ref-42354

---
Evangelism is every day and in every way helping your nonbelieving friends to take one step closer to Jesus Christ.12 — location: [481](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=481) ^ref-64347

---
Asking probing and thought-provoking questions that allows others to surface the truth for themselves is a fine art that all Christians need to better cultivate. — location: [537](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=537) ^ref-8646

---
Jesus also knew the value of allowing others to surface the truth for themselves. When He spoke to the woman at the well (John 4), He did not tell her “turn or you will burn.” Instead, He asked her a series of thought-provoking questions in a way that piqued her curiosity. — location: [552](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=552) ^ref-24128

---
One of the reasons He did this was to create a greater spiritual hunger in those who were interested. He also knew that it is not always best to share all that we know all at once. Toward the end of His ministry He told His disciples, “I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear” (John 16:12). — location: [557](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=557) ^ref-23511

---
This combined approach of asking questions, surfacing doubt, creating interest, uncovering hidden barriers, and building bridges to the cross is at the heart of pre-evangelism. — location: [589](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=589) ^ref-13933

---
pray for open doors (Colossians 4:3). — location: [605](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=605) ^ref-15078

---
Look for ways God is already at work in the lives of those you want to reach. Ask yourself, What are the signs that God is already working supernaturally in someone’s heart? Remember the situation in Acts 8 where the Spirit instructed Philip to go speak to the Ethiopian eunuch? We need to ask ourselves each day who are the people God is placing in our path specifically so that we can help them take one step closer to Jesus Christ. — location: [608](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=608) ^ref-51321

---
we need to also make the most of every conversation that we have with nonbelievers to help them take one step closer to Christ (Colossian 4:5; 1 Corinthians 9:22). — location: [614](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=614) ^ref-53025

---
1. Listening carefully in order to make every encounter count. Sometimes we miss opportunities to help nonbelievers take a step closer to Christ because we aren’t listening to them carefully enough and miss key ideas that could be a springboard to deeper spiritual dialogue. — location: [616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=616) ^ref-43730

---
2. Discovering what might create greater spiritual openness just as Jesus and the apostle Paul practiced (John 4:10; Acts 17:32). For example, Jesus’ approach with the women at the well in John 4 was to say, “If you drink of the water I give you, you will never be thirsty again!” — location: [622](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=622) ^ref-63997

---
Reflection 1. Ask yourself: Who do I know that I’ve had trouble witnessing to in the past using a more traditional approach to evangelism? What could I do differently in future conversations based on what I learned in this chapter (see John 16:12)? 2. If I truly believed that engaging others in pre-evangelistic conversations is necessary in today’s world, I would… 3. Remember to look for divine appointments daily. Ask yourself what are the signs that God is at work in someone’s life (Acts 8:29). — location: [627](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=627) ^ref-50724

1. Determine the three people you most want to reach with the Gospel (this could be family members, friends, neighbors, coworkers, classmates). Record their names under the space provided in your “Pre-Evangelism Conversation Strategies” worksheet from appendix 1. Ask God for wisdom (James 1:5) to know how to build pre-evangelistic bridges in your conversations with them over the next few months. 2. Pray for the three people you identified in the previous question, asking God to move in their lives in a way that creates greater spiritual openness. Ask God also for sensitivity in using daily conversations in ways that create greater openness for spiritual dialogue. 3. Pray for God to strengthen you to be a positive and consistent witness to the people in your life; pray that Christ would be evident in your life as you interact with them day by day (Philippians 1:14). 4. Pray for divine appointments to plant seeds of the Gospel of Christ with those around you as you go about your daily routine, and for God to give you the wisdom and strength to be a good witness in how you speak God’s truth to them (Acts 14:1). Meditate on Colossians 4:2-6. 5. Ask God to help you make the most of every conversation you have with a nonbeliever from this day forward. — location: [637](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=637) ^ref-6172

Each of these conversational types corresponds to the roles we need to play in our non-Christian friends’ lives: that of a musician, artist, archaeologist, and builder.2 As a musician, we want to listen more carefully, learn their story, and hear the sour notes people are singing to us (we’ll talk about this in chapter 3). As an artist, we want to paint a picture using questions to help others see themselves in a more true light. We want to clarify beliefs, surface uncertainty, and remember the three Ds of Conversational Evangelism (we’ll talk about this in chapter 4). As an archaeologist, we want to dig up their history and find the real barriers that are chaining them down. There are seven key steps to doing this (we’ll talk about this in chapter 5). As a builder, we want to build a bridge to the Gospel. We want to find common ground, build a bridge, remember the goal, and transition to the Gospel (we’ll expand on this role in chapter 6). — location: [686](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=686) ^ref-4578

Former Jehovah’s Witness David Reed insightfully observes that “A person can close his ears to facts he does not want to hear, but if a pointed question causes him to form the answer in his own mind, he cannot escape the conclusion—because it’s a conclusion that he reached himself.” — location: [743](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=743) ^ref-41018

---
We also want to do more than deconstruct unbelievers’ belief systems.7 We want to discover the real barriers that keep them from believing in Christ. — location: [746](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=746) ^ref-13016

---
Eight main ingredients make up this pre-evangelistic approach: 1) active listening, 2) positive deconstructionism,9 3) a questioning approach that allows others to surface the truth, 4) the boomerang principle,10 which involves removing the burden of proof from us to them, 5) determining the real barriers to the Gospel, 6) finding common ground, 7) a strategy for building a bridge to the Gospel (both intellectual and heart bridges), and 8) a basic knowledge of the Christian faith and what makes Jesus unique (see our suggested resource list in the back of this book). — location: [782](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=782) ^ref-17169

To proclaim that all views are true is to be illogical and stand for no particular truth. In reality you believe in nothing! Also, if there can be no one right answer, how can there be any hope in the world today? — location: [1043](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=1043) ^ref-52377

Belief versus heart longing is the discrepancy between a person’s worldview and his heart’s true longings. In our postmodern culture, there is a desperate longing, especially among young people, for a sense of belonging. They want to be a part of something bigger than themselves, yet their worldview does not allow for a sense of ultimate meaning and purpose for their life. — location: [1108](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=1108) ^ref-58106

---
The belief versus behavior inconsistency shows itself in the disjunction between what people say they believe and how they live. In Galatians 2:11-21 the apostle Paul confronted Peter about his inconsistent behavior. Peter had been eating with Gentile Christians in Antioch, yet when certain Jews came from Jerusalem, he stopped doing so. So Paul rebuked him since his belief and his behavior did not line up. — location: [1140](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00NWSRS5M&location=1140) ^ref-39174
