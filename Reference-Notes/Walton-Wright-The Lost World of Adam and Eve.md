## Highlights
To the dismay of those who take the Bible seriously, the various fields of science are often used to mount attacks against the Bible and against faith. Unfortunately, that has caused some to become dismissive or antagonistic toward science. This should not be the case for Christians since we affirm the importance of both special revelation (in the Bible and in Jesus) and general revelation (in the world that God has created and that science helps us understand). The fact that some wield science as a weapon against faith is no reason to think that science or scientists are the problem. The philosophy of naturalism is the problem. — location: [102](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=102) ^ref-63798

---
At the same time, the broad spectrum of core theology is retained: the authority of Scripture,2 God’s intimate and active role as Creator regardless of the mechanisms he used or the time he took, that material creation was ex nihilo, that we have all been created by God, and that there was a point in time when sin entered the world, therefore necessitating salvation. — location: [118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=118) ^ref-39464

---
Those who take the Bible seriously believe that God has inspired the locutions (words, whether spoken or written) that the communicator has used to accomplish their joint (divine + human author) illocutions2 (which lead to an understanding of intentions, claims, affirmations and, ultimately, meaning) but that the foundational locutions are tied to the communicator’s world. — location: [161](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=161) ^ref-47801

---
Comparative studies help us to understand more fully the form of the biblical authors’ employed genres and the nature of their rhetorical devices so that we do not mistake these elements for something that they never were. Such an exercise does not compromise the authority of Scripture but ascribes authority to that which the communicator was actually communicating. We also need comparative studies in order to recognize the aspects of the communicators’ cognitive environment3 that are foreign to us and to read the text in light of their world and worldview. — location: [169](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=169) ^ref-27911

---
we have long recognized that the Bible is not a scientific textbook. That is, God’s intention is not to teach science or to reveal science. He does reveal his work in the world, but he doesn’t reveal how the world works. — location: [175](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=175) ^ref-513

---
They would have viewed the cosmos not as a machine but as a kingdom, and God communicated to them about the world in those terms. His revelation to them was not focused on giving them a more sophisticated understanding of the mechanics of the natural world. — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=180) ^ref-24418

---
If we read modern ideas into the text, we skirt the authority of the text and in effect compromise it, arrogating authority to ourselves and our ideas. This is especially true when we interpret the text as if it is making reference to modern science, of which the author and audience had no knowledge. The text cannot mean what it never meant. — location: [198](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=198) ^ref-23401

---
that in the context of his native cognitive environment. Our procedure, then, is first to set aside our own cultural assumptions as much as we are able and then to try to read the text for what it is saying. — location: [288](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=288) ^ref-54930

---
We cannot start by asking of the Bible our scientific questions. The Bible is not revealing science, and the biblical authors and audience would be neither aware of nor concerned with our scientific way of thinking. Our questions would not resonate in their minds, and neither would they even have meaning to them. — location: [292](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=292) ^ref-12736

---
We want to know what questions they were answering and what the biblical communicator is affirming from his perspective. It is the Bible’s claims that have authority, and our procedures must focus on those claims as they were originally intended. — location: [296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=296) ^ref-33661

---
Some people give value to taking the biblical text “literally,” and, although that term can be a little slippery, we can all recognize the value of reading a text for what it intends to say—no more and no less. — location: [298](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=298) ^ref-9742

---
We cannot assume that they shared our materialistic, naturalistic, scientific perspectives and values or our obsessive focus on the physical world. We must set those aside and read the text afresh. — location: [305](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=305) ^ref-10902

---
Furthermore, we find that the way God carries out these creation activities (created, made, caused) is at times by “separating” and “naming.” To distinguish something from other things is to create it; to name something is to create it. For example, naming a room and giving it a distinct function distinguishes (separates) it from other rooms and represents the “creation” of the room. — location: [425](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=425) ^ref-26417

---
In the last chapter, I offered evidence that the activity of creation in the ancient world, including the biblical text, was seen largely in terms of bringing order and giving functions and roles. It included naming and separating. — location: [458](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=458) ^ref-55743

---
another Hebrew term that I believe refers to the solid sky.2 If this is the case, rāqîaʿ refers instead to the space created by the separating of the waters that are held back by the solid sky. That space would be the living space for all creatures. This space is significant in ancient Near Eastern cosmologies, particularly in Egypt, where they associate it with the god Shu. — location: [485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=485) ^ref-4432

---
As we examine the text closely, we realize that even though activities involve components of the material world (waters, dry land, plants), the verbs do not describe God making any of those objects. The seas are gathered, the dry land appears and the plants sprout. This is the work of organization and ordering, not the work of manufacture. The function of plant growth is initiated. This ordering provides the basis for food production. — location: [494](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=494) ^ref-13264

---
Days one through three, then, deal not with the manufacture of material objects but with ordering and establishing functions. — location: [505](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=505) ^ref-51878

---
In Israel, they believed they were exactly what the text calls them—lights, not material objects that produce light or reflect light. In the rest of the ancient world, they were also considered gods. No one knew that the sun is a burning ball of gas or that the moon is a rock in orbit that reflects the light of the sun. They believed these two lights to be very close (inside the solid sky, Gen 1:17). — location: [513](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=513) ^ref-24141

---
As the account of this day begins, we see that God says that the waters should teem with living creatures rather than saying that he made them. Those who have observed that days four through six are involved in filling the world are correct. — location: [523](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=523) ^ref-42605

---
The phrase “according to their kinds” is a statement of how order reigns in the ways that creatures reproduce. Sharks give birth to sharks, not to crabs; angelfish give birth to angelfish, not to stingrays. This is the same kind of statement that we saw in day three when God proclaimed that plants bear seed according to their various kinds. — location: [541](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=541) ^ref-10689

---
this world that is being prepared for humans in God’s image. All the functions and functionaries are discussed in light of that intended purpose—serving human beings. God is putting the cosmos in order not to serve himself but to serve humans. — location: [546](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=546) ^ref-41052

---
I would suggest that the functions of the animals and their role in the ordered system are addressed at the end of Genesis 1:26. When humans subdue and rule, they are identifying functions for the animals and determining what role they will play. This is part of the human role—to serve as vice-regents for God in continuing the process of bringing order. — location: [569](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=569) ^ref-51293

---
Here again, we see both ʿāśâ (Gen 1:26) and bārāʾ (3x in Gen 1:27) being used. At the same time, there is a clear focus on functions, the most important of which is found in the image of God. — location: [572](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=572) ^ref-17531

---
As God’s stewards, we are tasked to do his work in the world; we are to be his assistants in the order-bringing process that he has begun. — location: [588](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=588) ^ref-25416

Rest is the objective of creation. — location: [645](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=645) ^ref-8602

The work we desist from is that which represents our own attempts to bring our own order to our lives.2 It is to resist our self-interest, our self-sufficiency and our sense of self-reliance. — location: [681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=681) ^ref-5482

---
Many have believed in the past that the seven days related to the age of the earth because they read the chapter as a house story. The age of the earth pertains to that which is material. If this is a home story, however, it has nothing to do with the age of the physical cosmos. A period of seven days does not pertain to how long it took to build the house; it pertains to the process by which the house became a home. — location: [728](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=728) ^ref-53948

---
Reading the chapters as a home story allows the emergence of rich theology that is obscured by reading the text as a house story. We learn that, even though God has provided for us, it is not about us. The cosmos is not ours to do with as we please but God’s place in which we serve as his co-regents. Our subduing and ruling are carried out in full recognition that we are caretakers. Whatever humanity does, it should be directed toward bringing order out of non-order. — location: [737](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=737) ^ref-43002

The following data summarize the use of the word ʾādām in the book of Genesis: Twenty-two times with definite article: Genesis 1:27; 2:7 (2x), 8, 15, 16, 18, 19 (2x), 20, 21, 22 (2x), 23, 25; 3:8, 9, 12, 20, 22, 24; 4:1 Three times with attached preposition: Genesis 2:20; 3:17, 21 Nine times with no definite article or preposition: Genesis 1:26; 2:5; 4:25; 5:1 (2x), 2, 3, 4, 5 — location: [840](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=840) ^ref-64121

That leads us to question what the usual relationship is between the texts on either side of the introductory formula. As can be seen from figure 2, most of the uses of the introduction transition to a sequel account; a few, however, do not. Reference Relation Connection Genesis 5:1 parallel/sequel Cain → Seth Genesis 6:9 sequel Pre-flood condition → Noah Genesis 10:1 sequel Noah and sons → Table of nations Genesis 11:10 recursive Table of nations → Shem’s descendants Genesis 11:27 sequel Shem’s descendants → Terah/Abraham Genesis 25:12 sequel Abraham → Ishmael — location: [928](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=928) ^ref-22286

---
One example (Gen 5:1) has parallel genealogies that are joined by the introductory formula. Yet, Genesis 4:25-26 has already returned to Adam, so the introduction technically transitions between Adam and his descendants—a sequel relationship. Three of the examples (Gen 11:10; 25:19; 37:2) can be identified as recursive. In each of these, the section before the transition follows a family line deep into later history. The introductory formula then returns the reader to the other son in the family (the more important one) to tell his story. — location: [961](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=961) ^ref-8420

Far more than anything else, it is sacred space that reflects the fact that God is dwelling there (notice that Ezek 28:13 refers to Eden as the “garden of God”; cf. Ezek 31:8). — location: [1549](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1549) ^ref-28698

In the Gilgamesh Epic, the woman (Shamḫat) seduces Enkidu, with the result that he becomes civilized. Though the mechanism was sexual experience, the focus was the civilizing of a wild man. He gains reason and understanding (1:202), and Shamḫat then leads him to sacred space (1:209-10). In Genesis, the awareness of woman as a companion and ally comes first, and the sexual experience is constant reestablishment of an ontological whole. Again, Genesis turns the discussion upside down. Genesis is thus using common literary motifs to convey the truths about humanity that are the familiar topics of the conversation in the ancient world. They are operating in the same room of discourse, but Genesis has rearranged all the furniture. — location: [1650](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1650) ^ref-17646

From the start it is important to recognize that the garden, the trees and the serpent are symbols. By that, I do not mean to suggest that they are not real.1 We must simply recognize that they stand for something beyond themselves. That symbolized reality is transcendent and far more important than the physical realities, however one might assess the latter. — location: [1771](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1771) ^ref-23169

---
When we consider the Garden of Eden in its ancient context, we find that it is more sacred space than green space. It is the center of order, not perfection, and its significance has more to do with divine presence than human paradise. — location: [1775](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1775) ^ref-51198

---

Gardens were constructed adjoining sacred space as evidence of the fertility that resulted from the presence of God. They were not vegetable gardens or fields of crops; they were beautifully landscaped parks. They provided fruit that was offered to the god. Kings also built gardens adjoining their own palaces where they would receive (and impress) visitors. Thus, the text of Genesis can be seen to describe a garden, a park landscaped with exotic trees and stocked with wildlife. These were common accoutrements to temples and palaces in the ancient world. — location: [1780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1780) ^ref-23637

---
Whether they confer or represent, they provide what is only God’s to give. He is the source of life, which is given by him and found in his presence (Deut 30:11-20). He is the center of order, and wisdom is the ability to discern order. Relationship with God is the beginning of wisdom (Job 28:28; Prov 1:7). Consequently, we make a mistake to think that this is simply about magical trees in a garden paradise. It is about the presence of God on earth and what relationship with him makes available. — location: [1919](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1919) ^ref-61357

---
Regardless of our literary interpretation, the theology must be maintained: life and wisdom are the gifts of God, and human representatives incurred guilt for all of us by grasping the latter illegitimately and therefore losing the former. As discussed in chapter eleven, I believe that the biblical material makes the most sense when sin’s entry is seen as punctiliar rather than the result of a gradual process. — location: [1929](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1929) ^ref-47818

---
In the ancient Near East, life and wisdom are the prerogatives of the gods that they are reluctant to grant as they try to maintain distance between themselves and humanity. In the Bible, life and wisdom are possessed by God, and they are made available to humans as they are in relationship to him. The trouble comes when humans try to seize wisdom on their own terms. — location: [1960](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1960) ^ref-45512

Other elements can be found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead that connect to ideas that are evident in the Genesis account, including crawling on the belly, eating dust, a crushing head and striking a heel. — location: [1985](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=1985) ^ref-52380

---
The main adjective used there identifies the serpent as ‘ārûm, variously translated as “subtle,” “wily,” “cunning,” “shrewd,” “prudent” or “clever.” It is an adjective that operates primarily in reference to wisdom and is inherently neutral (that is, it is a quality that can be used well—Prov 1:4; 8:5—or in questionable ways—Ex 21:14; Josh 9:4). — location: [2028](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2028) ^ref-54924

---
we should notice that the serpent is not described as “evil.” This devious creature does not become associated with evil until much later. — location: [2039](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2039) ^ref-38523

Richard Averbeck is then correct to observe that this is not just a snake story. “The Israelites would have seen a great deal more in Genesis 3 than a simple tale about snakes and mankind. . . . From their point of view, this would have been the very beginning of a cosmic battle that they were feeling the effects of in their own personal experience and their national history.”20 Though I am not ready to go as far as he does to conclude that this also represents the fall of Satan, I believe that entering the text from the ancient Israelite viewpoint should lead us to think of the serpent in terms of a chaos creature. — location: [2056](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2056) ^ref-6333

We can see the difference if we compare two visual representations of the night sky—one taken by the Hubble telescope, the other presented by Vincent van Gogh’s The Starry Night. People would never consider doing astronomy from the van Gogh and could not do so even if they wanted to; the image contains nothing of the composition or position of stars. At the same time, we would not say that it is a false depiction of the night sky. Visual artists depict the world imagistically, and we recognize that this depiction is independent of science but not independent of truth. The ancients apply this same imagistic conception to all genres of literature, including those that we cannot conceive of as anything other than scientific. Imagistic history, like that preserved in Genesis, is to history as The Starry Night is to a Hubble photograph. — location: [2119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2119) ^ref-4980

---
Some scholars today believe that Israel was in the habit of borrowing other people’s myths and transforming them into a mythology of their own. I do not share that perspective. What is sometimes perceived as a shared mythology is more often a shared propensity to think imagistically about the same issues using a shared symbolic vocabulary. — location: [2141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2141) ^ref-21769

---
The fall was the decision to be like God, conveyed by the serpent’s words (Gen 3:5), the woman’s response (Gen 3:6), God’s assessment (Gen 3:22) and the reason for the banishment (Gen 3:23). — location: [2210](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2210) ^ref-5184

---
In taking from the tree, Adam and Eve were trying to set themselves up as a satellite center of wisdom apart from God. It is a childish sort of response: “I can do it myself!” or “I want to do it my way!” These are not a rejection of authority per se but an insistence on independence. The act is an assertion that “it’s all about me,” and it is one that has characterized humanity (individually and corporately) since this first act. — location: [2217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2217) ^ref-6628

---
Wisdom is good, and we can therefore safely assume that God did not intend to withhold it from humanity. But true wisdom must be acquired through a process, generally from instruction by those who are wise. The fall is defined by the fact that Adam and Eve acquired wisdom illegitimately (Gen 3:22), thus trying to take God’s role for themselves rather than eventually joining God in his role as they were taught wisdom and became the fully functional vice-regents of God involved in the process of bringing order. — location: [2222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2222) ^ref-61917

---
Instead, we can have a much more charitable attitude toward Adam and Eve when we realize that it is not that they initiated a situation that was not already there; it is that they failed to achieve a solution to that situation that was in their reach. Their choices resulted in their failure to acquire relief on our behalf. Their failure meant that we are doomed to death and a disordered world full of sin. These are profoundly significant consequences for what was a serious offense. In contrast, Christ was able to achieve the desired result where Adam and Eve failed. We are all doomed to die because when they sinned we lost access to the tree of life. We are therefore subject to death because of sin. Christ succeeded and actually provided the remedy to sin and death. — location: [2234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2234) ^ref-9892

All non-order will not be resolved until new creation. In Revelation 21 we are told that there will be “no longer any sea” (Rev 21:1), no pain or death (Rev 21:4) and no darkness (Rev 21:23-25). There is no temple because God’s presence will pervade all of it (Rev 21:3, 22), not just concentric circles radiating through zones of diminishing sacredness. God will be with humanity and be their God (Rev 21:3). Relationship is conveyed through the imagery of husband and wife (Rev 21:2). This is not a restoration of Eden or the return to a pre-fall condition. New creation is characterized by a level of order that has never before existed. — location: [2321](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2321) ^ref-63941

Christ is the true image of the invisible God (harking back to Gen 1). He is the firstborn of all creation (placing him above Adam). In him all things were created (identifying him specifically as the Creator in every act of creation, including Gen 1). He created all things visible and invisible (the previous point identified who the Creator was/is; this one addresses what he creates; comprehensively includes both material and function/order in the human realm in that which is visible). He created all spiritual powers (expanding the range of creation to also include the spiritual realm). He is before all things (and therefore non-contingent). — location: [2483](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2483) ^ref-60595

The problem is the Great Symbiosis: they are constructing sacred space, but they are doing so for their own benefit—that their name might be exalted as a thriving, prosperous civilization. Making a name for oneself in the ancient world was a way to secure one’s memory through successive generations. Sacred space should exalt and establish the name of God, but these people see it only as a way to improve their situation. God will presumably be flattered and pleased and therefore bring prosperity to the people. — location: [2506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2506) ^ref-57381

God is not pleased, and he disperses the people by confusing their languages. This brings non-order to their community and makes it impossible to complete their project.1 At the same time, it becomes the basis for the geopolitical order that is described in Genesis 10. — location: [2512](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2512) ^ref-1305

People (God’s images) were placed in sacred space just as the images of the Babylonian gods were placed in sacred space in their temples to mediate God’s presence and God’s revelation. But images were excluded in worship in Israel—we are the only images God allows. — location: [2989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=2989) ^ref-54609

Certainly we make a choice when we affirm that God is the Creator. But when we tell the young people reared in a Christian faith that there is a war between science and faith and that if they accept certain scientific conclusions, they will be abandoning the Bible, they often believe us. Then, when they are confronted with a very persuasive presentation of an old earth or a case for common ancestry from the genomic record, they decide that the Bible must go. It is not because they no longer believe in Jesus but because they have been taught that believing in an old earth or believing some form of evolutionary theory is not compatible with believing the Bible. They have heard their revered pastors tell them that people who believe in evolution cannot be Christians. In repeated surveys of those who have become disillusioned with the church, this is listed as one of the primary reasons. — location: [3159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00U073NUW&location=3159) ^ref-41827
