## Highlights
The method is to show through the examination, word by word and phrase by phrase, of a few passages, which have been much exposed to hostile criticism, that the New Testament is unique in the compactness, the lucidity, the pregnancy, and the vivid truthfulness of its expression. — location: [95](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=95) ^ref-18341

---
The episodes in the first and third Gospels, describing the circumstances of the Savior’s Birth, are of the highest importance; Luke sets that event in relation with the tides and forces of Imperial world-history, and Matthew describes how the traditional wisdom of Asia recognized the new-born King. On the other hand, John says nothing about such mundane matters, because his thought moves on a far higher plane, and his eye is fixed only on the infinite Divine nature; while Mark restricts himself to recounting what he had learned about the public career of Jesus as a Teacher. — location: [113](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=113) ^ref-34850

Scholarship had been a learning of opinions, and not a process of gaining real knowledge. One learned what others had thought, but not what truth was. — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=286) ^ref-35784

The earliest Christian epitaphs belonged to the period when the religion was proscribed and forbidden, and when it was necessary to avoid drawing public attention to the Church by the use of language that was patently and explicitly religious. Yet even in that period certain forms and turns of expression were employed which conveyed a meaning to those who were in the secret. — location: [567](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=567) ^ref-15645

Among other old books that described journeys in Asia Minor the Acts of the Apostles had to be read anew. I began to do so without expecting any information of value regarding the condition of Asia Minor at the time when Paul was living. — location: [575](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=575) ^ref-17062

---
But about 1880 to 1890 the book of the Acts was regarded as the weakest part of the New Testament. No one that had any regard for his reputation as a scholar cared to say a word in its defense. The most conservative of theological scholars, as a rule, thought the wisest plan of defense for the New Testament as a whole was to say as little as possible about the Acts. — location: [586](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=586) ^ref-50292

---
I began then to study the Acts in search of geographical and antiquarian evidence, hardly expecting to find any, but convinced that, if there were any, it would bear on the condition of Asia Minor in the time when the writer lived. — location: [589](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=589) ^ref-49345

---
Just in the same way it was understood that this detail of the journey of Paul and Barnabas was deliberately invented by the writer (who was under a false impression about the situation of Iconium and the frontier) with the intention of imparting to the story plausibility and the interest of personal experience; and the writer of the book was condemned as an impostor attempting to rouse the readers’ sympathy and thus to trade on their credulity. — location: [621](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=621) ^ref-32646

Here in Acts 14:5, we have a test case: at this point it seemed to me, when I began this study of Anatolian geography, that the story had been proved to ring false. The author of the book imparts a piece of topographical information incidentally, as his narrative hurries on; but the information is false and results from his applying a piece of schoolboy knowledge, true in regard of 400 B.C., to the different circumstances of A.D. 47. Not merely did this statement seem to us to be wrong: it is given in this incidental fashion as part of the travel narrative, so that it appears as if it were part of the actual experience of the wandering Apostles. — location: [630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=630) ^ref-21384

Iconium was not in Lycaonia at that period. — location: [636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=636) ^ref-17629

side. It is a very large stone in shape like an altar, about five feet high, bearing the inscription: “On behalf of the salvation and everlasting continuance of the Emperor Caesar Hadrian, son of the god Trajan, grandson of the god Nerva (then follow the titles, giving the date A.D. 135), the senate and people of the city Apollonia, settlers from Lycia and Thrace, (dedicated) to the Frontier-gods.”[6] — location: [662](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=662) ^ref-43109

Then the lame man walks; and the populace, quick to appreciate divine power and disposed to believe that the gods appear from time to time on the earth like men, conclude that here before their eyes is an epiphany of their two chief and associate deities, Zeus and Hermes. Then they call out in the Lycaonian language. It was the first time that Paul had ever heard that speech, and the contrast to Iconium with its Phrygian and its Greek caught his attention and his memory. — location: [705](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=705) ^ref-1480

Cicero in one place says that Iconium was in Lycaonia,[1] and on a superficial view certainly any reader gets the impression that he thought of Iconium as a Lycaonian city. — location: [794](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=794) ^ref-22792

---
The geographical impression is the same. Iconium lies on the edge of the great Lycaonian plain: true, it is under the shadow of the mountains that fringe the plain on the west,[2] and the mountains are not classed as Lycaonian; but, though near the limiting mountains, Iconium is distinctly in the level plain. So far as geographical considerations are concerned, the city belongs to Lycaonia. — location: [797](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=797) ^ref-4071

---

The truth is that those ancient writers who had actually visited Iconium call it a Phrygian city, although strangers and Cicero sometimes call it a city of Lycaonia. The writer who composed this history, which we call the Acts of the Apostles, must therefore be ranked along with those who had visited Iconium.[1] — location: [866](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=866) ^ref-62052

character. Hellenism was a stronger power than Romanism in the East: but strongest of all was the old language in a town like Iconium. The people did not cease to speak Phrygian in their home life. Greek was the speech of education and public intercourse, for the city was a Hellenistic organization, but Phrygian survived. This language the visitors to Iconium heard, as in Lystra they heard the Lycaonian.[1] — location: [942](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=942) ^ref-61793

In the beginning of May of that year we came to the city at an interesting moment.[1] The municipality, desiring to get stones for building purposes, had recourse to the usual kind of quarry in Turkey, viz. the ruins of the ancient city. In the modern town there is a low hill, on which stands the Mosque of Ala-ed-Din, also the old church of St. Amphilochius,[2] the modern Greek church of the Transfiguration, and the Armenian church. Here also are some scanty remnants of the once stately palace of the Seljuk Sultans. In this hill the municipality proceeded to dig, and at once began to find inscribed stones. These were seized by the Imperial Museum, which, however, declined to pay any part of the expense of finding them. The Municipality then refused to dig for the benefit of the museum and stopped the excavation. — location: [984](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=984) ^ref-6382

Now, both Xenophon in the Anabasis and Strabo, p. 663, say in the most explicit way that the traveler, as he went along the road, passed out of Phrygia into Lycaonia. The geographer Strabo is describing in that passage a traveler’s route along the great road across Asia Minor from Ephesus to the Euphrates; and the traveler Xenophon is describing the march of Cyrus from Sardis to the Cilician Gates. Strabo’s evidence carries us back to the second century B.C., for he quotes the statistics from Artemidorus; but it gives his own knowledge, for he had himself traversed that part of the road. Similarly, Luke is describing the victorious march of Paul across Asia Minor; and exactly as Xenophon does, he remembers to record the passage across the frontier on the road between Iconium and Lystra. — location: [1095](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1095) ^ref-56962

The reversal of our judgment, then, was complete.[1] We had imagined that this detail was a blunder due to stupidity or ignorance or misplaced ingenuity on the part of the author: it has now been found to show excellent knowledge and the minute accuracy which comes from the faithful report of an eye-witness and participator in the action. — location: [1119](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1119) ^ref-62441

Regarding Lycoania and Iconium

---
Now the condemnation which, as soon as it was tested in respect of one detail, had been proved hasty and false, evidently could not be relied on in respect of other details without being tested. Fresh examination of the whole question was needed. The reasons and grounds for our unfavorable judgment regarding the book of the Acts must be reconsidered. Prejudice must be set aside. Ignorance of the circumstances of every event must so far as possible be replaced by knowledge through fuller study. Every condition had to be revalued. Every point had to be scrutinized again. — location: [1123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1123) ^ref-7047

---
Of course, there is a certain presumption that a writer who proves to be exact and correct in one point will show the same qualities in other matters. No writer is correct by mere chance, or accurate sporadically. He is accurate by virtue of a certain habit of mind. Some men are accurate by nature: some are by nature loose and inaccurate. It is not a permissible view that a writer is accurate occasionally, and inaccurate in other parts of his book. Each has his own standard and measure of work, which is produced by his moral and intellectual character. — location: [1127](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1127) ^ref-17465

Instead of trying to find arguments in its favor, we must frankly confess that it was wrong, and re-try the case as a whole. — location: [1134](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1134) ^ref-62181

---
The present writer takes the view that Luke’s history is unsurpassed in respect of its trustworthiness. At this point we are describing what reasons and arguments changed the mind of one who began under the impression that the history was written long after the events and that it was untrustworthy as a whole. — location: [1144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1144) ^ref-3785

One could not but notice that the ordinary non-theological scholars quoted the writings of Luke without hesitation for facts of Roman antiquities. Scholars who aimed simply at collecting facts, and had evidently no bias either for or against him, seemed to regard him as a sufficient authority, whereas the theological scholars, who came with a strong bias on certain issues, looked on him as utterly untrustworthy. Only on one point of Roman antiquities all were agreed, from all sides, in denouncing his statements as incredible: this was the famous passage in the Gospel of Luke 2:1–3, which everyone regarded as a tissue of blunders of the most marked and worst kind. To this passage we shall return later in this book and for the present deal only with the Acts. — location: [1203](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1203) ^ref-9068

---
The variety is remarkable. The propriety of the references, and the naturalness and suitability of the incidents, are perfect. The more one knows about Græco-Roman society in the east, the more deeply is one impressed with the life-like character of the scenes described in rapid succession, so briefly yet so pregnantly, in those chapters of the Acts. — location: [1249](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1249) ^ref-21609

---
Take, for example, that scene which is alluded to in the paragraph almost immediately preceding (Acts 23:2ff.). It has been much criticized. How could Paul, it is asked, be ignorant that it was the high-priest who issued the order to smite him on the mouth? The dress and insignia of the high-priest were unmistakable, also his position in the meeting as the president of the Council. — location: [1270](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1270) ^ref-39983

---
however, it is clear that this was not a formal meeting of the Council of the nation, it was an assemblage of leading men hastily summoned as advisers by the Roman officer in command at Jerusalem. The officer was in authority: he was the one man that could judge and give a decision: the rest were only his assessors. By no means could a proper meeting of the Council be called in the way followed on this occasion. He summoned “the chief priests and all the Council;” they were the persons whom he would naturally ask for the information he needed; but this does not constitute a proper meeting of the Council for its own business. — location: [1276](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1276) ^ref-27031

Acts 23:2ff

---
The officer’s report is, if anything, a more complete justification of Paul than the facts narrated by Luke are; the Roman takes the most favorable view, and practically says “there is no case that I can find against the prisoner, but these Jews hate him so much on religious grounds that his life is not safe here.” Roman policy at the beginning favored the free teaching, as Luke loves to show. — location: [1297](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1297) ^ref-38648

priest. Moreover, Paul used the Hellenic and wholly anti-Hebrew expression, “I have lived the life of a citizen.” The very word was an offense to the stricter Jews: the thought expressed in such a word was Hellenistic and not Palestinian. One can hardly imagine that a man like Paul, so sensitive to the atmosphere and emotion of the audience which he addresses, would use the term “citizen” in apostrophizing a Jewish Council; but here he is speaking with the officer as his judge, and he has to make his defense so as to convince the Roman. Nominally he has to address the Jewish notables; but his real audience is the officer. The last words which he had spoken to the latter contained the word “citizen,” and he now continues on the same key, “I have lived as a citizen.” — location: [1302](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1302) ^ref-50266

In itself the mere teaching and lecturing was quite permissible by Roman law and practice; and therefore an accuser had to elicit some crime out of Paul’s conduct and to make a charge against him accordingly. In Philippi he had interfered with the livelihood of a small private firm; in Ephesus he was hindering the trade of a powerful corporation; in Thessalonica he was preaching about another sovereign, and was thereby guilty of treason to the sovereign (maiestas); in Corinth he was tampering with the law of the Jews; in Athens, the University city of the world, he was encroaching on the privileges of the corporation of recognized professors in philosophy, i.e. the four schools.[1] Here again the variety is infinite; each new case is different from the old, and yet each is natural, each is typical of the society and the period, each rises necessarily out of the preceding situation. — location: [1377](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1377) ^ref-10406

Again, it is characteristic of an early period in the history of the Christian faith that the religion itself is never made a charge. Beginning from the Flavian period,[1] Christianity was treated as in itself a crime; the very name constituted a grave charge whose penalty was death. There was never any difficulty in regard to the form of the accusation against any Christian teacher from about a.d. 78 onwards. After that time no accuser would stop to formulate small charges, when this great and capital charge was ready to his hand. Why trouble to get witnesses in support of a less serious accusation, when the great accusation required no witnesses, and was proved by the mere acknowledgment of the accused person, “I am a Christian,” and was followed forthwith by the death penalty? — location: [1390](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1390) ^ref-64609

---
In many places the Jews cause the trouble, because Paul was a thorn in their side, partly hurting their self-esteem because he placed the despised pagans on the same level of religious privilege with them, partly interfering with the standing and income of the synagogue by drawing the God-fearing Gentiles away to follow himself: these persons, who formed a fringe of believers attached externally to the Jewish faith, must certainly have constituted a source of income to the synagogue as well as of social influence to the “Nation of the Jews” in the city.[1] — location: [1417](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1417) ^ref-53270

---
There is, however, one case in which the forms of the Roman law are not observed. What is the reason for that? The exception is Athens, and Athens was a free city which governed itself according to its own laws in its ancient fashion through its own courts. Here Paul appears before the old Athenian Court of Areopagus which had been highly important in the old Athens of early Greek history, and which became again very important in the University city of Imperial times. — location: [1422](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1422) ^ref-30661

It is really astonishing, sometimes, to see how commentators prefer the darkness to the light, and error to truth. — location: [1440](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1440) ^ref-38712

In an American city in 1913 I received a letter from an eminent chemist, who confused me with my more distinguished namesake the Professor of Chemistry in London University: he reminded me of a former visit which I had paid to his laboratory, and invited me to come again to see how much progress he had made in the problem of transmutation since I had last visited him. — location: [1563](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1563) ^ref-20273

Probably Simon was more powerful in this occult domain, while Barjesus had more of the character of a student of the powers and processes of nature, in which aspect he was an object of interest to the judicious and philosophic Roman governor of Cyprus. — location: [1581](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1581) ^ref-61984

These incidents, numerous as they are, find a proper place in Luke’s history, because he is refuting an accusation that was commonly brought against the Christians. Like the magicians, so the Christians also were stigmatized by the populace as maleficent, malevolent, and haters of the human race. The violent antipathy which the mob cherished towards the adherents of the new religion was justified to the world on the pretext that these Christians were like magicians, practising secret rites, unlawful arts, and abominable hidden crimes. — location: [1604](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1604) ^ref-31883

---
Luke makes no direct answer to this or any other charge against the Christians. He merely exhibits in history the Christians as inevitably in conflict with all magicians and as invariably superior in power to them. — location: [1616](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1616) ^ref-2461

The incidents described in the Acts, however, are so individual and so varied that they must come from actual life. The stories are true to life because they are so diverse, while all belong to one generic type. — location: [1629](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1629) ^ref-44191

In short, Simon recognized the power of God. The powers of this world recognized the true power of God. Even the devils believed and trembled. — location: [1665](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1665) ^ref-40434

As the sequel proved, he did not understand that it was the appeal to the soul and spirit, and to the higher nature, of his hearers, that gave Philip his power over the people.

The relation of Simon to the really Christianized converts among the Samaritans recalls to my memory the experience and testimony of a friend, a foreigner, a Catholic, and a distinguished scholar, who spent a considerable time in the Belgian Congo investigating the facts of the rubber trade. Expressing high admiration of the Baptist missionaries, he said that the Catholic missionaries made a hundred converts where the Baptists made one; but the one was a real convert, a man of changed character, while the hundred remained savages as they were before. Simon the converted remained in his innermost nature exactly the same as he had been before. — location: [1759](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1759) ^ref-53677

The almost total lack of home training for the child is in fault. So long as he does not annoy his elders too much, he is left to the freedom of his own caprice.

The story is reported by Luke for several reasons, but especially it serves to disprove the charge of magic made against the Christians. — location: [1924](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1924) ^ref-8321

It used to be maintained that the contest between Paul and Bar-Jesus was invented as a pendant to the story of Peter and Simon the Magian; as Peter in old legend had triumphed over a magician, so Paul also must have his own triumph. — location: [1936](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1936) ^ref-34351

---
Moreover, the author is not content with making his hero (according to the theory) vanquish one magician; he makes him convince a large number, and break their power. Peter does not vanquish a magician; he simply rebukes him for his inability to understand Christian truth; there is no contest of power at Samaria: Simon was a humble pupil, and an unsatisfactory one. — location: [1940](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1940) ^ref-46964

Matthew we notice that the Magians were familiar with Jewish books.

Jews were, by natural character, likely to be adepts in the art of utilizing for their livelihood the weaknesses of human nature: hence Jews of low character, even though they were of high birth, appear among the magicians or exorcists at Ephesus. — location: [1974](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=1974) ^ref-47269

The belief was widespread in the world at that time or earlier that the Epiphany or coming of a god in human form on earth, was imminent, in order to save the human race from the destruction which the sins of mankind deserved and had brought nigh. The world was perishing in its crimes, and only the coming of the God Himself could save it. This belief can be observed in various forms during the years that preceded. It prompted the Fourth Eclogue of Virgil and it is seen in the Second Ode of Horace. To them it means the glory and the triumph and the permanence of Rome. — location: [2030](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2030) ^ref-38988

---
These Roman authorities show what were the forms in which this expectation was current in the pagan world during the century from Virgil to Vespasian. In the Hebrew prophecy the restoration of power to the East, and the end of the domination of the West, were implied; but the Romans understood, and Suetonius carefully explains, that the real meaning was the domination of the West over the East. — location: [2047](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2047) ^ref-5091

Luke seems to regard belief as the first stage in a process. The second stage is “turning to the Lord,”[2] of which the seal is baptism, and which is consequent on believing. Later there ensues the settled Christian life of those who are styled in the perfect tense πεπιστευκότες, who are in the state of them that have come to believe.[3] — location: [2281](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2281) ^ref-38868

---
The case which Luke presents to the Roman world rests on this general attitude: the State had decided, first through the action of a provincial governor (Junius Gallio, Seneca’s brother), and afterwards by the formal judgment of the Supreme Court of the Empire,[1] that the government should take no heed of such matters, i.e. that teachers might teach and preachers preach as they pleased (so long of course as they did not make themselves liable to prosecution for treason or disrespect to the Emperor or any other crime). — location: [2332](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2332) ^ref-52337

Beyond this it is quite clear that during the first century public opinion did not concern itself with the doings of individuals, except for a time under Nero and again under Domitian, both Emperors whose acts were repealed at their death. — location: [2341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2341) ^ref-24121

To the pagans salvation was safety, health, prosperity; but even in pagan usage “the word never wholly excludes a meaning that comes nearer to reality and permanence;” it is never wholly material and ephemeral; “there is latent in it some undefined and hardly conscious thought of the spiritual and the moral, which made it suit Paul’s purpose admirably.”[2] — location: [2397](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2397) ^ref-33868

---
This passage well illustrates the close relation between the pagan vows for salvation, and the offer of salvation which Paul brought to the Græco-Roman world. He offered them something that they wanted and were praying for; and in the offer he took the opportunity of purifying and spiritualizing their conception of that salvation, which they were trying “to purchase by vows or to extort by prayers and entreaties from the gods.”[1] He gave them what they wanted, and yet something far above what they could ask or even think.[2] — location: [2405](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2405) ^ref-11913

As Professor Kennedy on p. 95 says “the hope of immortality is conveyed to their votaries through an elaborate ritual,” the center of which was formed by “grotesque myths” in which was “embodied the return to life of Osiris and Attis.” — location: [2450](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2450) ^ref-49194

By the term Paulinism it is needful to explain that I mean Christianity as expressed by Paul to the Græco-Roman world—not a development out of the Teaching of Jesus, nor a superstructure built upon that Teaching, but the expression of it in a form which could be readily comprehended by his pagan hearers, and become vital and creative among them. — location: [2479](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2479) ^ref-26966

Along with the religious conceptions and the organizing forms, Paul (and in much smaller degree the pre-Pauline teachers) adopted the names and words of existing society. He did not attempt to create a new Christian language:[1] such an attempt must have proved vain, and would have stultified itself: he must speak to his audiences in their own language if he wished to reach their heart.[2] But the already existing words he filled with a fuller and richer and more spiritual content.[3] — location: [2497](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2497) ^ref-5607

The teaching of Paul remains always on a higher level than we can attain, and yet it is always in a degree intelligible and vitalizing even to the simplest religious heart; and there is a power in it that is even more effective and intelligible to the simple religious consciousness than to the complex theological mind. — location: [2506](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2506) ^ref-21946

The regions where the new religion spread at first most rapidly were those where the people were becoming aware of the beauty of Greek letters and the grandeur of Roman government, where they were awaking from the stagnation and inertness of an Oriental people, and their minds were stirred and receptive of all new ideas, whether Greek philosophy or Jewish or Christian religion.[3] Here and always we find that the spread of Christianity was favored by intelligence and freedom of mind in those among whom it was first preached.[1] — location: [2518](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2518) ^ref-29873

Papas literally means “father,” and this title was commonly applied to the supreme God in Asia Minor, especially in Bithynia and North Phrygia. It also was one of the commonest personal names all over Anatolia, especially in the less hellenized districts.

society. In Phrygia the family unity even included the married sons with their wives: the “brides” (νύμφαι) were part of the household.[1] Hence the salvation is besought for the family as a whole; and, when the head of a household found salvation (as in the case of Lydia and the jailer at Philippi) the entire household shared in it, and if the salvation took a Christian form, they received baptism in a body. — location: [2603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2603) ^ref-17738

III. Another dedication found at Kuyujak, between Dorylaion and Nakoleia, was copied by Professor Sterrett in 1883. I have not seen the stone.

It is remarkable that the idea of “Salvation” should be so closely connected with the making of the grave. Respect to the dead is a prayer for the whole family and its permanence and prosperity. The dead has gone to be a god with the gods; the tomb is his temple; and the worship of this new god is inaugurated with the grave and epitaph, which are the discharge of a vow to secure his blessing for the entire household. In the two dedications Timon the foundling is regarded as identified with Zeus the Thunderer and with Zeus of Dagoutta. — location: [2664](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2664) ^ref-29328

From the beginning of its history Christianity was brought into the closest relations with the state and the religion of the Emperors. Paul obscurely hints at the worship of the reigning Emperor, “him that calls himself God,” and the dead Emperors in 2 Thessalonians 2:1–12. The Revelation of John is absorbed in the conflict against him that sits on the throne of Satan. After the time of Vespasian “a charge of Christianity was tested by calling on the accused to perform the ceremonies of loyalty and worship of the Emperors.”[1] From the beginning to the end of the contest with the State this worship of the Emperors was the immediate enemy of the Christians in a far more pressing way than the worship of Jupiter or the other gods. A few indulgent governors of provinces were willing to accept as the test of loyalty for accused Christians their oath by the salvation of the Emperor;[2] and even Tertullian permitted this oath to be taken by Christians.[3] — location: [2681](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2681) ^ref-28248

Thus the vows for salvation of the Emperor illustrate the unity of the household, a feature so marked in Acts 16:15, 33, 1 Corinthians 16:15. They also show how closely the person of the Emperor was connected with the life and conduct of the people in the provinces, in the first place of the cultivators of the great estates, and in the second place of the ordinary provincials who came to imitate more and more the fashion that ruled on the estates. — location: [2710](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2710) ^ref-53046

“For the fortune and victory and eternal continuance of our Lords and the salvation of his whole household the (association of coloni called) ‘Guest-friends of the Symbol’ dedicated a bronze (statue of) Fortune;” then follows a list of names and subscriptions with date by the secretary of the society.[1] This inscription was incised on the pedestal of the statue of Good Fortune, which was erected with the money contributed by the association of cultivators of the estates. An example of a similar dedication, erected by the city of Apollonia, is published on p. 44 above. Here the Emperor and his family, who are summed up as “our Lords,” are conjoined with the body of tenants (coloni). The latter are organized as a religious association uniting in the worship of the Lords Emperors. In this case the identification of the Imperial family as a whole with the gods of the association is unusually clear: the Imperial family is the divine family, the god, the goddess, and the child. — location: [2718](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2718) ^ref-24052

The paternal government was “Salvation” in the estimate of the cultivators on the estates. It had its advantages. The Father God through his procurators protected his people, advised them, told them their duty, looked after peace and order, punished them for their faults, and in general made life easier for them. In the degeneration and growing disorganization of the Empire, freedom lost its charm, and gradually ceased. The freeman was more exposed to oppression and insult than the serf. He could not protect himself, while the serf had his master to protect him from some of the evils of life. — location: [2766](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2766) ^ref-6888

A strong and general popular belief is a great power. The new idea as preached by the Apostles had this great power supporting it and pushing it forward. And there was no pretence on the side of the Apostles and of the Church. They felt and knew what a revolution they were making in the world. They saw with their own eyes that the souls and bodies of men were growing healthier around them; and they knew that the cause was simply and solely belief in the Jesus whom they were preaching. Their own faith was made stronger by those cures, as well as the faith and character of the people that were cured. — location: [2852](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2852) ^ref-39684

The episode of the Ethiopian is an exception: this figure, in short, finds a place in Luke’s pages mainly for the purpose of bringing into relief the character and power and influence of Philip, and not as indicating an important direction in the growth of the new Faith towards the south. Such a story was not gathered from Philip himself, but from a warm admirer of Philip. Yet admiration does not affect the representation of the facts. The same limitation to Philip’s power is observable here as at Samaria. Philip can only baptize; his influence does not carry with it the gift of the Spirit. — location: [2877](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=2877) ^ref-26518

A number of the German critics, followed by many outside of Germany, used until recently to say without hesitation that Augustus never issued any decree ordering a census, that there never was under the Empire any regular system of census, that where any casual census was held the presence of the wife was not required but only of the husband, and that his presence was never required at his original home. — location: [3128](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3128) ^ref-24370

Further, in respect of the dating by the governorship of Quirinius, it was asserted by a large number of critics, (1) that Quirinius never governed Syria until a.d. 5–6, nine years after the death of Herod, and (2) that the census which he then made in Palestine was transferred by Luke’s simple blundering to the reign of Herod, who died in 4 B.C. Then, when this transference had been made in defiance of historical truth, the circumstances and manner of a Roman census (which as a matter of fact were unknown to the critics) were manipulated and misrepresented by Luke so as to make it appear that Joseph of Nazareth came to Bethlehem to be counted (which there was no need for him to do), and that Mary also came to be counted (although, even if her husband had for some reason been required to appear at Bethlehem, there was no possible cause why her presence should also be called for). — location: [3136](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3136) ^ref-26698

This knowledge cannot be proved by mere verbal argument. It is not in word, but in power. It does not spring from any more fundamental principle.

The interval between the enrolments could not be recovered from the scattered references to a census. One in a.d. 35 has been already mentioned in the previous chapter. The one mentioned by Pliny occurred in 48 apparently.[1] Tacitus mentions a census held in the provinces of Gaul at the end of the events of a.d. 61. Vespasian and Titus were censors in 73–74. We now see that these correspond in a loose way to the census periods of a.d. 34, 48, 62 and 76; but the correspondence is inexact. — location: [3341](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3341) ^ref-57535

If Tertullian had only the authority of Luke to rest on, it is inconceivable that he could have named Sentius as the officer that made the census, for he regarded Luke as a perfect authority.

From a fair, unprejudiced and rational consideration of the evidence of Luke, Pliny, Tacitus, Clement and Tertullian, we conclude that the statements of Luke are all probable in themselves, and that the theory either of invention or of stupid error on his part is unreasonable and unjustifiable. — location: [3505](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3505) ^ref-3325

Such was the custom of the census at a later period after Luke was dead. It is clear that, if he was inventing this general order, he like a prophet described exactly what was going to be the method at a later time. Such an idea is absurd!

Accordingly Rostowzew[1] infers without any hesitation from Luke that “already in the beginning of the Imperial period all people, whether inhabitants of cities or of villages, were summoned to return to their proper domicile (ἰδία) for the census exactly as was customary in Egypt.” He considers Luke’s words a sufficient proof that this was the general Augustan rule. — location: [3676](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3676) ^ref-65428

Wilcken has observed another important feature of the Household enrolment. Not merely were written census returns handed in; but the entire population had to present themselves personally for inspection. This he infers from a passage in a London Papyrus with practical certainty, and rightly calls it a very important point.[1] “Accordingly,” as he says, “Joseph and Mary in the legend of Luke must both go to Bethlehem.” The argument which Wilcken has in mind is that Luke, who knew this regulation to hold in every census, invented this detail regarding the journey of Mary in order to be true to the custom. Luke’s narrative used to be called a legend, because it was historically false. Now it is called by Wilcken a legend because every detail has been demonstrated to be exactly correct. There is no way of satisfying those people who have made up their minds. — location: [3780](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3780) ^ref-48830

The critics ridiculed the idea that Mary should have to return to the home, even if by any chance Joseph had to do so. The head of the house was sufficient. Wilcken has shown that every member of the household had to be present for enrolment, and that therefore Mary would have to go with Joseph. The only inference which he draws from this is that the legend arose out of the law and practice. — location: [3793](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B096W9YJMK&location=3793) ^ref-19378
