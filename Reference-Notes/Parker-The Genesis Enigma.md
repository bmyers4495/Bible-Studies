I found that it had evolved in a group of trilobites, which lived around 521 million years ago. That’s just before the Cambrian explosion began. It was not hard to put two and two together. — location: [72](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=72) ^ref-43987

In 1998 I published my “light switch theory” in a scientific journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. This theory holds that it was the sudden introduction of vision in life forms on earth that triggered the Cambrian — location: [74](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=74) ^ref-14603

The first is Erasmus Darwin’s idea that the cause of causes is God, not the causes themselves. This allows us to accept all of science along with a God who perhaps made the most basic building blocks of the universe, from which everything self assembled via the laws of physics and biology. — location: [121](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=121) ^ref-52150

Certainly I am not at a particular moment in my life where I need the comfort of religion, so I can feel objective rather than “faith based.” But to accept purpose in the universe, and consequently the existence of God, is inevitably to take on an element of faith. If only there were reliable evidence for such purpose, to relieve faith of the entire burden . . . I hope that the reader will find some in The Genesis Enigma. — location: [129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=129) ^ref-12060

Could it be that the creation story in Genesis was written as it was, complete with its seemingly odd order, because that is in fact the correct order of events at the beginning of the world? Modern science has revealed in stunning detail how the world and all of the life on it came into being. We are now in a position to make a comparison of the two accounts. — location: [141](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=141) ^ref-55324

The Masoretes, believing themselves guardians of the sacred text, exercised extreme, bordering on obsessive, care in making new copies of their Hebrew Bible. All parchment used had to derive from ceremonially clean animal skins and had to be tied together by strings taken from similarly clean animals. Their ink had to conform to a special recipe. They could write nothing from memory, and each word copied from an authentic version of the text had to be read aloud first. Each scribe had to wipe his pen before writing the word for “God” (Elohim), and wash his whole body before writing the word for “Lord” (Jehovah). — location: [284](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=284) ^ref-49649

It is important to note that when the Masoretic text, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Septuagint are compared, their religious doctrines agree (though outside the Masoretic text there are inevitable errors in copying and variations in spelling). This provides an excellent test of the authenticity of the Masoretic Old Testament. — location: [294](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=294) ^ref-50375

To the inexpert (which is most of us) the cuneiform tablets may all look the same, but sometimes they contain riches, albeit not immediately obvious riches. Jursa’s discovery was the description of a mundane commercial transaction that took place in 595 BCE. A little dull so far, perhaps, but as well as the date, the tablet named an official, one Nebo Sarsechim. The confirmation that Nebo Sarsechim had existed as “chief eunuch” in 595 BCE was pure gold. According to chapter 39 of the book of Jeremiah, a character called Nebo Sarsechim was present with King Nebuchadnezzar II himself at the siege of Jerusalem that is known to have taken place in 587 BCE. — location: [472](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=472) ^ref-61092

So, Woolley and Lawrence had uncovered the original sites of Carchemish and Kadesh Barnea, cities mentioned in the Old Testament that played significant roles in biblical history. Then Woolley had shed light on Ur and its Sumerian inhabitants, people who later became absorbed into a larger Mesopotamian culture as depicted in the Old Testament. — location: [501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=501) ^ref-2021

As our proto planet developed, it was always in danger of being struck by one of the other planetary bodies that hurtled around in the same pocket of space. The inevitable happened, and the earth was hit by a body about the size of Mars. It was hit so hard that the debris blasted off the surface formed the moon. — location: [1042](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1042) ^ref-11284

The energy that the earth had been handed at its embryonic stage had become unrecognizable. The earth remained a vast ball of energy, but it had been converted to many different forms. Hard rocks and water characterized the surface, with molten rock below and a unique gaseous atmosphere above. Lots of atoms, with their animated electrons and ample nothingness, were being joined together in a variety of ways (as mentioned in the previous chapter, atoms are more than 99 percent empty space). This would lead to just the right mix of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur for . . . life. — location: [1067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1067) ^ref-15076

While Venus never cooled enough to have liquid water, and Mars and the moon were too small to hold on to their atmosphere long enough for its elements to be stored in their mantles, the earth sat pretty in the solar system. It was just the right distance from the sun to retain its water mainly in liquid form, rather than as ice or vapor. — location: [1073](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1073) ^ref-6089

That he devoted one of his few stages in the creation to the sea is interesting, since the sea, as we will find in the following chapters, was necessary for life itself and the diversity of modern life. Yet the writer of the creation account of Genesis 1 lived in a landlocked region, and even Moses tended to opt for the desert over the coast. — location: [1085](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1085) ^ref-62539

---
We have now seen the formation of the sun (“Let there be light”) and the separation of land and sea, and both are found in their right sequence in science and in Genesis. The story may seem rather predictable so far; but with the next stage in the earth’s history described by the writer of Genesis, as we shall see in the following chapter, the odds in favor of guesswork begin to fall. — location: [1090](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1090) ^ref-11635

Up to this point we have covered, through the vehicle of the history of science, the basics of evolution, including one of the central mechanisms by which it works, natural selection. There are other mechanisms, including sexual selection—which centers on improving attractiveness to a potential mate—but by now we have a feel for the robustness of the science. We know that life diversified through the various mechanisms of evolution: Life evolved. All life can be traced back to a single, common ancestor—a single cell. But what about the next step back? How did that first cell originate? — location: [1376](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1376) ^ref-58843

---
It is extremely appropriate that the author of Genesis chose plant life for this third stage in his creation account—it accords particularly well with the science. In fact he couldn’t have chosen better. But he was not to know this. Why he so appropriately listed grass, herb, and fruit tree is a question we will leave until later. It is also interesting that water was absolutely necessary for life to have appeared at all, and water was singled out in the Genesis account’s previous stage. — location: [1482](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1482) ^ref-27425

news. The only phyla most people are really familiar with are the “chordates,” to which we belong; the “arthropods,” including the insects, spiders, and crabs; the “mollusks,” including snails and squid; the “echinoderms,” including starfish (sea stars) and sea urchins; and the sponges and jellyfish, which we have been discussing. Most zoos would be filled with these animals only. These are what the non biologist would invariably mean by “animals”—one fifth of the whole story. — location: [1724](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1724) ^ref-35443

---
Working away in his lab, Cuvier discovered that four groups—chordates, arthropods, mollusks, and jellyfish—each possessed their own, unique internal organization. This finding was of immense importance. The concept of the phylum—the highest classification of animals, at the other end of the hierarchy from the species—was born, and biology accelerated from there. — location: [1741](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1741) ^ref-61807

Slotting a lens into the body of a digital SLR camera, complete with its light sensing array, and connecting the camera to a computer for image processing, one is reminded of the human visual system. The human eye and associated visual cortex in the brain mirror this camera in its lens, retina, and processing unit. But that’s the crux of Darwin’s dilemma—the visual system comes in three unrelated parts. For such an eye to evolve, all three parts must evolve independently and simultaneously. That, at first, does appear absurd. — location: [1754](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1754) ^ref-39678

---
The evolution of lenses may owe something to physical phenomena such as crystallization or similar sorts of molecular self assembly. If an enzyme, such as a liver enzyme, is overproduced within a cell it will crystallize—our own lenses are formed this way. Calcitic lenses in brittlestars—relatives of starfish, or sea stars—also evolved in this manner, and those in the very first eyes in the proto trilobites very probably did likewise. — location: [1809](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1809) ^ref-30095

---
The point is that the words “extreme perfection” used by Darwin are inappropriate with respect to the eye. He would have been troubled less by the eye if he had understood that no eye is ideal. — location: [1825](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1825) ^ref-21724

---
Evolutionary language speaks of “selection pressures”—invisible forces in the environment to which natural selection reacts. If a potential does exist, then one of the myriad mutations, constantly stirring at each generational turnover, will surely realize it, sooner or later. The selection pressure acting on the soft bodied trilobite was to become a predator. And, sure enough, the proto trilobites with eyes did indeed evolve into efficient predators—they gave way to the trilobites. — location: [1875](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1875) ^ref-55597

---
We have now reached the point, 521 million years ago, when the trilobites evolved. We have covered vast swaths of geological time to get here. Remember, the earth formed some 4,600 million years ago, with the first signs of life at 3,900 million years ago. The first photosynthetic forms—the cyanobacteria—appeared around 3,600 million years ago, while cells did not group together until about 1,600 million years ago, when Volvox like forms emerged. At 635 million years ago the first multicelled animals evolved, and thereafter these went on gradually to evolve further into the thirty seven phyla we have today. Then, at around 521 million years ago, the trilobites evolved: the first animals to possess hard skeletons and eyes. — location: [1916](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1916) ^ref-19988

---
There’s no mention of life on land yet, regardless of the fact that this is the moment where the variety of animal life—all those kinds of “creature”—is established. Why would the writer record such a thing? It goes against all he knows. In fact, it portrays what he does not know. — location: [1934](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=1934) ^ref-25448

Extraordinarily, the Genesis creation story implicates a diversity of sea creatures. There is no way such diversity could have been understood at that time. — location: [2067](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2067) ^ref-65436

In essence, when the biblical text is taken literally, it is left in the wake of an advancing science. But when it is read figuratively, it not only keeps pace with the hottest science, it precedes or heralds it. I am left to question why theologians should choose to insist upon the literal option, through false logic and shoehorned evidence, when the figurative or symbolic alternative is both honest and supportive of religion. — location: [2075](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2075) ^ref-12428

---
So why does Genesis not, as one would surely expect, discuss only the chordates, or at least the five or six phyla that make up the modern zoo, when describing the creation of animals on earth? The answer could be that its writer was recording the true, scientifically accurate story, and not the version understood by the people of his time. — location: [2084](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2084) ^ref-16475

---
To summarize the point we have got to in the evolutionary story line: At some time in the Cambrian period the animal kingdom burst into life. This was the time of the Cambrian explosion. Prior to this, animals were all soft bodied, like worms, as they had been for 100 million years since the first multicelled organisms. Then, in a relatively short space on the geological timeline, nearly all the animal phyla on earth today independently evolved hard parts. At no other time in the earth’s history has there been such a profusion, such an exuberance, such an overwhelming diversity achieved in so short a time, within about one million — location: [2092](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2092) ^ref-278

Brains probably evolved alongside the eye—to exploit the new information that the visual organ was ever more providing. When the eye first evolved and saw the potential around it, its host animal’s body and brain would have quickly evolved to catch up and realize the potential. In other words, the new model predators were likely consequences of the first eye. — location: [2123](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2123) ^ref-20296

So what animals are represented among the Chengjiang fossils? They may belong to the same groups of animals that exist today, but at first sight they certainly don’t look the same. Actually, like those of the Burgess Shale they appear as the most bizarre life forms one could ever imagine. Choia is a sponge, but seems like a tiny traditional Chinese hat with needles radiating from the edges. Xianguangia is a relative of today’s jellyfish and corals, but looks like an octopus stuck headfirst in a beaker, with tentacles waving above. Microdictyon, a “velvet worm,” appears as a caterpillar walking on long legs with rows of shields protecting its body from attacks from above. — location: [2193](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2193) ^ref-60952

The meteorite explanation for the dinosaurs’ demise is the best theory we have, but it is still just that, a theory in the true sense of the word: That is to say, it could be wrong, as opposed to “evolution by natural selection” which, as I will argue in the final chapter, is more appropriately regarded as “fact.” — location: [2485](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2485) ^ref-40344

---
In general, theories never become facts in science—they explain facts. But since this does not translate well into everyday language, where “theory” is held to be synonymous with “could be wrong,” evolution is best described as a fact. — location: [2487](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2487) ^ref-12260

Fatefully, one branch of the rodents also evolved to become the primates—monkeys and apes. — location: [2492](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2492) ^ref-37662

Switching to a finer timescale, by 160,000 years ago, in Kenya’s Rift Valley, a branch of the ape lineage had evolved—through leaving its treetop home and exploiting the savanna beneath on two legs—into the modern human. As mentioned briefly in chapter 1, these humans traversed the globe. They traveled south into South Africa and north into the Middle East, from where they spread to northern Europe, India, Siberia, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, and Australia by around 22,000 years ago at the latest. — location: [2493](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2493) ^ref-42685

In some ways it is sad to see those centuries of knowledge, built from the ancient Greeks up through Copernicus, Newton, Buffon, Linnaeus, Cuvier, Darwin and Wallace, and Einstein being used as a weapon to destroy religion. The question I cannot avoid is: Why? On the one hand there’s nature and the scholarly view of how it got here and how it works, but on the other there’s the wonder and beauty that somehow make up another “subject” interwoven with the science. — location: [2573](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2573) ^ref-36806

efficiently—tend to be those that survive to leave a legacy. The cosmological and biological tales have been interwoven through our history of scientific endeavor, yet these two stories only surround a central subject that is energy. They never penetrate it. Energy remains a chasm in our knowledge, and in the Genesis Enigma it has singled itself out as something special. More about this is in the final chapter. — location: [2584](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2584) ^ref-50126

As his health declined Audubon would move on to mammals, with the help of his sons. But by this time he was already acclaimed as America’s first great watercolorist, and a pioneer of art and science. Soon he would also be known as an environmentalist. Still, magnificent as Audubon’s watercolors are, they sometimes lack a certain something when compared with the living hues of the models themselves, for nature has more ways than the artist of producing color. — location: [2636](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2636) ^ref-11521

Imagine cells as tiny factories, all with the same machinery. If the machines are switched on, they make their distinctive products, or body parts. If switched off, they stop work. This is why the same color producing devices persistently reappear in birds, and indeed in animals in general. All that machinery was put in place in the single celled life forms that lived some 2,000 million years ago, and from which all multicelled animals evolved. — location: [2725](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2725) ^ref-16081

In a nutshell, when describing how the planet and life around us came to be, the writer of the Genesis narrative got it disturbingly right. — location: [2762](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2762) ^ref-3285

But there is another question to pose, relating to the energy behind all of this. For the first time in this book, I will ask, “What is energy?” The only answer we can give is a short one—we do not know. — location: [2814](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2814) ^ref-63906

So rather than squeezing God into the gaps, or forcing Him to retreat with each scientific discovery, maybe we could recognize two realms in the universe—one we are capable of understanding, above all through science, and one that we never will understand. — location: [2819](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2819) ^ref-49939

We have seen how science and the book of Genesis agree, point by point, verse by verse. Science came to its account of the history of the universe and of life through centuries of painstaking research, engulfing the life’s work of many vigilant and impartial thinkers, forever fine tuning the story until it fitted the facts. But how did the writer of Genesis come to his conclusion? The following chapter will carry out the last remaining task—to consider the possible answers to that question. — location: [2828](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2828) ^ref-10777

In other words, there may be a realm of the universe that science can explain, and a realm that it cannot. Our understanding of the realm that science cannot explain may remain static, unchanged since the beginnings of scholarly societies. It does seem that Plato’s “beauty,” like consciousness, was just as well understood in ancient Greece as it is today. On that note, is it right that Darwin’s progress made religion an irrational choice altogether? — location: [2951](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2951) ^ref-40919

---
In my role in the development of this gallery I was forced to meet one word head on—“theory.” It is a word no longer apt in this context, for the weight of evidence for evolution has become crushing. The “theory of evolution” has become “evolution, the fact.” This is important to religion. — location: [2963](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2963) ^ref-41046

Although Darwin accepted that the truth he had uncovered placed religion in doubt—such doubt, indeed, was later to cause the Christian captain of the Beagle, Robert Fitzroy, to commit suicide—he went nowhere near as far as the modern atheists in tearing God, as a supernatural creator, to shreds. The atheists’ world is a dark one. We live until we are eighty and that’s it. We are but a few grams of salts and several pints of water. The universe is made up only of matter as can be explained by our laws of physics. There’s no soul, everlasting spirit, or higher force to call upon, and concepts such as fate and destiny are illusions. But that’s not what Darwin was about. In this sense we should leave him out of the debate. — location: [2972](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2972) ^ref-25293

Science can offer some wonder to us as a species, but maybe only religion can provide guidance and purposefulness to the individual passing through his or her daily routine—particularly when that routine is lived out in a concrete city. — location: [2989](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2989) ^ref-54183

If asked what would happen to the first living organism to evolve, I would not predict “reproduction.” What benefit to the first individual could be gained from reproducing? If anything, reproduction requires an energy sacrifice. Science tells us what happens during the process of reproduction, but I can’t find an explanation for why it happens at all. And then, given that individuals do reproduce, why do they speciate? — location: [2995](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=2995) ^ref-2891

Errors provide evidence against the creation—God’s system must be error free, and yet, as we see in our world of science, it is not. But maybe, since they represent a departure from parsimony, errors provide a challenge to science, too. — location: [3009](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3009) ^ref-31355

I am also warming to the idea that we are better off, as individuals, living with religion than without it.

I agree that no one has the right to tell anyone what they should believe in—but come on, all you advocates of the Bible’s every word: If you believe simply because your faith tells you so, then just accept that faith is your only argument. This would be far more dignified than childishly mangling the facts and concocting a dishonorable theory into which they can be stuffed. It’s no wonder that scientists cannot take such theories seriously; and, worse than that, the scientific world will begin to label religion as unintelligent and unreasonable. — location: [3064](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3064) ^ref-29287

Consider medicine. Microbes also, unfortunately for us, undergo evolution. A dose of an antibiotic is met by genetic mutations that eventually make the microbial targets resistant. Virulence evolves. What is true for microbes and antibiotics is also true for crop pests and pesticides.

If one lays the facts of the universe on the table, there is actually something left after science has accounted for all it can account for, or is likely to account for in the future considering the way that it works and progresses. Such a view requires a complete lack of any bias, including the atheist style faith that science will eventually account for everything. — location: [3118](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3118) ^ref-51355

altruism toward other group members was found to improve the overall fitness of the group. Since the group becomes fitter with altruistic behavior, altruism can be explained as a characteristic that has evolved. But the Moral Law also includes instances of behavior that provide no conceivable positive value to either an individual or a species. If we fail to own up to receiving too much change at a supermarket, we walk away feeling an ache in our conscience, yet negligible harm has been done to any individual—who cares about depriving a multinational conglomerate of a few pennies?—and there has been negligible gain to ourselves. No, humans appear to possess something additional to the altruism found in other species. This add on quality lies at the heart of the Moral Law. — location: [3144](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3144) ^ref-45536

C. S. Lewis went further to suggest that what lies behind the universe is more like a mind than it is like anything else we know. Here, God is defined not as the anthropomorphic form figured at the beginning of this chapter, but as so far removed from our perceptions or imagination that we cannot begin to reconstruct or ever conceive of “His” form or kind. — location: [3154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3154) ^ref-7876

Our senses are extremely limited, but this is something very difficult to understand. And this must present a problem when it comes to deciphering God. We know our universe from our senses alone (well, in addition to some scientific detector equipment). It follows that since our senses are finite, we cannot ever know everything about our universe. This is the all important fact which, I feel, is often overlooked by atheists. What we know about our universe may be merely the tip of the iceberg. — location: [3162](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3162) ^ref-16976

---
Working within this framework, if there is a God then it would not be surprising that some things are encountered that do not make sense, or cannot be explained with science. The Moral Law falls into this category, along with why there is a universe at all, how it formed, and what it formed from. — location: [3178](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3178) ^ref-1002

If we were to recreate life on earth using only evolution—survival of the fittest, and so on—would we expect to develop a sense of beauty in our environment? Would we expect to sense drama when faced with a soaring, shattering ice cliff in Antarctica or a rhythmic avalanche in the Himalayas?

Perhaps the greatest inconvenience to atheists is the fact that the Bible remains the centerpiece of our library, after all these years. It still sits on our tables, inviting our interrogation. It just won’t go away. — location: [3259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3259) ^ref-5251

Faced with these observations, I can’t help asking: Is the atheist crusade to destroy religion really a positive step, or even necessary? Probing further into my Italian experience, I’m wondering whether religion is a critical element in the human mind, a link in the physiological chain that, when complete, makes for happiness and emotional balance? In this view, God is synchronized—in harmony—with the human mind, in that the divine ether is interfaced with the matter in our bodies. Such an interpretation could account for C. S. Lewis’ Moral Law, and could help us to understand why a fully integrated God—a situation where there’s no separate word for religion—is better for us. — location: [3280](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3280) ^ref-46945

Moses, or the writer of Genesis 1, must have understood that the universe formed first, then the seas appeared on earth, and that life forms were photosynthetic. Further, he must have realized that an eye evolved in an early animal in the geological past, which triggered the evolution of all the major groups of animals that exist today. Further still, he must have felt that this all occurred in the sea, before animals moved onto land, and only when they did move out of the water did mammals and birds evolve. — location: [3310](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3310) ^ref-40416

Here, then, is the Genesis Enigma: The opening page of Genesis is scientifically accurate but was written long before the science was known. How did the writer of this page come to write this creation account? From where did his thoughts, evidence, imagery, or inspiration come? The appendix that follows sets out what we know about this person, such as whether he was academically inclined. But I must admit, rather nervously as a scientist averse to entertaining such an idea, that the evidence that the writer of the opening page of the Bible was divinely inspired is strong. — location: [3364](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3364) ^ref-49930

Creationism and atheism are neither scientific theories nor demonstrably true. If we do not allow them to cloud our judgment then God can appear as a rational answer as to why we exist on earth. — location: [3373](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B002RCJC5S&location=3373) ^ref-64371
